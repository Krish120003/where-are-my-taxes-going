    "description": "Environment and Climate Change Canada operates aerological observing stations throughout Canada. These stations complete soundings of the upper atmosphere twice daily for each day of the year. The observations are taken by releasing a gas-filled balloon with an attached instrument (radiosonde) which is tracked via one of a variety of electronic navigational methods. This attached instrument transmits meteorological data to the Canadian Meterological Center relating to temperature, humidity, wind shear and the height of standard atmospheric pressure levels for including in atmospheric models used in forecasting and global weather monitoring.",
