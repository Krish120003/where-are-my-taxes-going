    "full_summary": "**Aerosol Particle Charge Conditioner Request for Proposal (RFP)**\n\n**Notice ID: EN578-20ISC3/65**\n**Notice Date: 2023-02-06**\n**Closing Date and Time: 2023-03-17T14:00:00**\n\n**Project Description:**\nThe National Research Council (NRC) is seeking a proposal from a contractor to design and develop an aerosol particle charge conditioner that can induce a stable and repeatable unipolar or bipolar charge distribution on a population of aerosol particles.\n\n**Background:**\nAerosol measurements have significant applications in disease transmission, air quality monitoring, climate forcing, and nanomaterial synthesis. The NRC's Metrology Research Centre (METRO) has extensive experience with aerosol measurements and seeks to reduce the associated measurement uncertainties.\n\n**Requirements:**\nThe proposed solution must meet the following essential outcomes:\n\n* Produce a unipolar and bipolar charge distribution\n* Produce known charge distributions correlated with particle mobility diameter\n* Not generate ozone or undesirable gas species or aerosols\n* Have low particle losses with transmission efficiencies greater than 75% for particles with mobility diameters between 10 nm and 25 nm\n* Have a residence time of less than 20 seconds for greater than 95% of particles\n\n**Desired Outcomes:**\nThe proposed solution should also meet the following desired outcomes:\n\n* Control the mean elemental charges per particle\n* Be switchable between positive unipolar and negative unipolar charge distributions\n* Produce a known bipolar charge distribution for a range of high volumetric flow rates\n* Produce charge distributions that are stable over 8 hours\n\n**Submission Requirements:**\nTo prepare a bid, please refer to the Solicitation Documents, which contain the process for submitting a proposal. All enquiries must be submitted in writing to [TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca](mailto:TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca) no later than ten calendar days before the Challenge Notice closing date.\n\n**Contact Information:**\nFor further information, please contact:\n\n* Group, PSPC\n* [TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca](mailto:TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca) (email)\n* 10 rue Wellington, Gatineau, QC, K1A 0"
