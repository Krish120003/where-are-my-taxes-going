    "full_summary": "# Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV) Tender Announcement\n\n## Overview\nThe Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) is soliciting bids for design services to update the current Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV) design, encompassing modernized systems, and conduct feasibility studies focusing on alternative power plant designs to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions.\n\n## Background\nThe CCG operates four (4) ACVs, primarily supporting search and rescue, icebreaking, and marine navigation services. Due to their aluminum build and icebreaking core function in harsh environments, the ACVs have a relatively short in-service life expectancy. The CCG has a requirement for naval architecture/engineering services to update the current ACV design and conduct feasibility studies to explore alternative power plant designs.\n\n## Trade Agreement and Procurement Category\nThis procurement is subject to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) and falls under the Service (SRV) category.\n\n## Limited Tendering Reasons\nThe procurement has been determined to be a limited tendering opportunity due to the exclusive ownership of the Intellectual Property (IP) rights to the GHWAP1-88 series of Air Cushion Vehicles by Griffon Hoverwork Limited. The CCG believes that Griffon Hoverwork Limited is the only supplier capable of performing the required design work and feasibility studies on the GHWAP1-88 series of ACVs.\n\n## Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN)\nThis ACAN allows interested suppliers to signal their interest in bidding by submitting a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities must clearly demonstrate how the supplier meets the advertised requirements, including experience in providing design services for mature and proven ACV designs and conducting feasibility studies.\n\n## Criteria for Assessment of the Statement of Capabilities\nTo meet the requirements, the supplier must:\n\n1.  Demonstrate a mature and proven ACV design that meets CCG's High-Level Mandatory Requirements.\n2.  Own the IP rights to the ACV design and have access to the full design package.\n3.  Have experience providing design services for a mature and proven ACV design.\n4.  Have experience conducting feasibility studies on an ACV design.\n\n## Contact Information\nContact Information: Jonah Dube, Supply Team Leader, 11 Laurier St, Phase III, Place du Portage, Gatineau, Quebec, K1A 0S5. Phone: (873) 561-6976, Email: Jonah.dube@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\n\n## Closing Date for Submission of Statements of Capabilities\nThe closing date"
