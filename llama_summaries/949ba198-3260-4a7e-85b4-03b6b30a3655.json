Transport Canada is interested in undertaking research to determine whether ECT value alone can be a sufficient specification in determining the performance capability of a single or doublewall corrugated fibreboard box or whether the grammage (i.e. basis weight) value is a necessary component in demonstrating fibreboard box performance in accordance with UN performance testing",
