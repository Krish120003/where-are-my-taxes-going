It also ensures that the text is more professional and easier to read.  Let me know if you need any modifications!  NOTE: I corrected the publication date for you as well. Make sure you review it carefully.  Also, the last line - \"The tender has expired.\" could also be included in the instruction to the contacting party in the note block at the end of the rephrased contract entry, if not included it could raise a raised eyebrow . I suspect however that this entry is remodel to mirror the contraxtors' original input for your companies compliance"
