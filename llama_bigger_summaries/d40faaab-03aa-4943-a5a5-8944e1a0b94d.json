    "description": "Intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) are one of the most commonly used means of containment (MOC) for transportation of dangerous goods (DG) in Canada. The CAN/CGSB-43.146 (Design, manufacture and use of intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) for the transportation of dangerous goods, classes 3, 4, 5, 6.1, 8, and 9) sets out requirements for the design and manufacture of UN standardized IBCs. Section 5.6 of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) Regulations specifies that UN standardized IBCs must be in compliance with sections 2 and 3 and Part I of CAN/CGSB-43.146. The types of IBC of interest in this work are the common ones used by industry for the transportation of dangerous goods: Lightweight IBC Light-gauge rigid material casing and frame Composite IBC with an outer casing made with light-gauge rigid material and plastic inner receptacle generally made by the blow-molding method. (GRV l\u00e9ger)Rigid plastic IBC Rigid plastic body and plastic frame Composite IBC Rigid plastic body and metal frame Metal IBC Metal body and frame The main difference between lightweight IBC compared to other IBCs is the more fragile material used for both its casing and frame. This difference exposes life cycle the lightweight IBC to a higher chance of containment release (leak of dangerous goods) during an accident. It has been noted by TC that the use of lightweight IBCs to transport DGs has increased over time. This may be due to the lower cost of lightweight IBCs, their ability to hold large volumes of DG, and the low surcharge fee for their consignment as opposed to higher quality IBCs.",

The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the overall costs and environmental sustainability of the transportation and use of IBCs over their life cycle.\n\n**Background:**\nIBC is a common method of containment for the transportation of dangerous goods in Canada. The CAN/CGSB-43.146 standard outlines the requirements for the design and manufacture of UN standardized IBCs. However, the use of lightweight IBCs has raised concerns regarding their fragility and higher risk of containment release during accidents.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\n* Perform a life cycle analysis of four types of IBCs (lightweight, rigid plastic, composite, and metal)\n* Rank each IBC type on overall cost effectiveness and environmental impact\n* Identify best practices for the selection and use of IBCs for the transportation of dangerous goods\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\nThe winning proposal will be selected based on the highest combined rating of technical merit and price.\n\n**Tender Documents:**\nThe tender documents, including the Request for Proposal and accompanying information, can be found at the following link:\nhttps://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/22629/rfp-t8080-230262.pdf\n\n**Contact Information:**\nFor more information, please contact:\nNatasha Blackstein, Transportation Canada\nnatasha.blackstein@tc.gc.ca\n(343) 550-2321\n\n**Trade Agreements:**\nThis solicitation is subject to the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement.\n\n**Languages:**\nThe official languages of this solicitation are English and French. **Note:**\n\nBelow is an extract from the original notice.\n \n*Languages can be used for respondent references to distinguish versatile infrastructure programming necessities.
