    "full_summary": "=====================================\n\n**Advance Contract Award Notice:**\n=====================================\n\n**System Upgrade for Toxic Gas and Monitoring System:**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe National Research Council Canada (NRC) intends to award a contract to a pre-identified supplier for the upgrade of its Toxic Gas and Monitoring System (TGMS). The upgrade aims to replace and update existing components and programming to support an investment project requiring the expansion of the existing facility to support the NRC's operational and Research and Development projects.\n\n**Background:**\n---------------\n\nThe Canadian Photonics Fabrication Centre (CPFC) of the NRC provides specialized semiconductor fabrication services for a wide array of external clients. The CPFC offers foundry services, end-to-end fabrication of photonic devices, and design and testing services.\n\n**Requirement:**\n----------------\n\nThe CPFC has a requirement for a Gas Monitoring System upgrade. The upgrade consists of updating the existing TGMS to support an investment project requiring the expansion of the existing facility. The current TGMS system is not large enough to handle the additional points required by the new construction and must be modified and expanded.\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n------------------------\n\nTo assess the capabilities of interested suppliers, the following criteria must be met:\n\n1.  The Engineer assigned to the project must have significant experience with TGMS and semiconductor facility gas detection designs, installations, system integration, start-up, service, and sustaining support.\n2.  The Engineer assigned to the project must guarantee a seamless expansion of the existing CPFC where old and new TGMS operate on a single network fully compatible.\n3.  The Engineer assigned to the project must have a system that incorporates any detection Modbus/TC IP device for integration into an expanded CPFC TGMS.\n4.  Any interested supplier must demonstrate by way of a statement of capabilities that they have significant experience in conducting projects and at least three semiconductor TGMS installations projects that are similar in size and complexity.\n\n**Pre-Identified Supplier:**\n---------------------------\n\nKoetter Fire Protection International LLC has been pre-identified as the supplier for this contract. The company has significant experience in TGMS and semiconductor facility gas detection designs, installations, system integration, start-up, service, and sustaining support.\n\n**Contract Period:**\n-------------------\n\nThe estimated duration of the contract is 18 to 24 months from start to completion.\n\n**Closing Date for Submission of Statements of Capabilities:**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe closing date for submission of statements of capabilities is August 15, 2023, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.
