The APN is not a request for proposals, but rather a notice to indicate the anticipated security requirements for the project.\n\n### Project Overview\n\nThe Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft Program plans to acquire long-range patrol aircraft to replace the existing fleet of CP-140 Aurora aircraft. The new aircraft will be based at Canadian Forces Base 14 Wing Greenwood, Nova Scotia, and CFB 19 Wing Comox, British Columbia. The program will require new infrastructure and renovations to existing facilities to support the new aircraft at both bases.\n\n### Project Scope\n\nThe APN pertains to the potential Modified-Design Build (MDB) contract for the construction of a 3-bay maintenance hangar at CFB 19 Wing Comox. The project will include:\n\n- Design development, construction drawings, and specifications for the new hangar\n- Construction of the new 3-bay maintenance hangar, which will include two first-line maintenance bays, one wash bay, workshops, storage, and administrative office space\n- Construction of a new mission support centre (likely part of the hangar)\n\n### Security Requirements\n\nTo be eligible for contract award, a consultant or contractor must hold a valid and active Facility Security Clearance (FSC) at the level of SECRET, granted or approved by the Contract Security Program (CSP) of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).\n\n### Sponsorship Request Process\n\nDCC offers early access to the security clearance application process through its Industrial Security Program (ISP). Interested consultants and/or contractors who do not hold the required security clearance can initiate the sponsorship request process by submitting an application to DCC through its website. The application must include the contract number (81656) and level of clearance requested.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* 30 calendar days prior to the planned solicitation closing date, for Designated Organization Screening (DOS)\n* 60 calendar days prior to the planned solicitation closing date, for Facility Security Clearance (FSC) at the level of SECRET\n\n### Contact Information\n\nFor questions related to the sponsorship request process"
