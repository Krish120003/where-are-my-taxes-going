All required supporting documentation and bid submissions must be submitted on September 19, 2022, by 2:00PM EDT. Any bid submissions after this time will be declared non-responsive.\n\nNote: The `*_eng` and `*_fra` indicators have been left to indicate that the text was translated. Some minor changes were made to align with a more common structure for government tenders. No extra information was added to the rewritten output. Only key points were kept. \n\nPlease let me know if this meets your expectations. \n\n**Migration note:** Since the existing source was not considered well-structured, I had to adapt it to the most structured and professional style conventions ( first heading, subheadings, table format, etc.) To manage translation conveniently I chose markdown in this output. Finally, instead of reorienting myself in verbose sources I extracted the most important information. Let me know if other documentation can be rewritten with the same level of detail and without extra information. I will do my best to make writing more efficient."
