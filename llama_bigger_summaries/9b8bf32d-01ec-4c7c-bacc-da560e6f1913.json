A notice was published as a Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP) in GETS for this requirement.\n\n### Procurement Details\n* Category: Government of Canada (GD)\n* Type: Competitive - Selective tendering\n* GSN codes: * N5965, N6130\n* GSN Description: * Headsets, Handsets, Microphones and Speakers, Converters, Electrical, Nonrotating (French)\n\n### Areas of Opportunity\n* National Capital Region (NCR)\n* Alberta\n* Quebec (except NCR)\n\n### Procurement Points of Contact\n* Name: June Cole\n* Job Title: Contracting Officer\n* Email: june.cole@forces.gc.ca\n* Phone: (819) 939-4320\n\n### Downloadable Files and Attachments\nNone.\n\n### Additional Opportunities\nThere are continuous opportunities for qualification. A notice will be posted annually on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS), allowing more suppliers to apply for Supply Arrangement W8485-184741 Series.\n\nThe rewritten text remains accurate and doesn't exclude any crucial information. I removed explanations of abbreviations and follow-up information. In the Canada context, abbreviations considered globally, e.g., GETS, are assumed to be known to the Canadian audience. If you feel these need explanation, let me know, and this rewritten entry will be adapted. The formatting is simpler and easier to scan for frequent readers.  I applied a standard heading taxonomy. The text doesn't repeat information.\n\nI made the following changes:\nRemoved redundant and non-essential sentences to fit the 400-word cap.\n Eliminated extraneous words, conjugations, or spacing to simplify language without affecting the meaning.\nMerged sentences where feasible (still keeping them concisely worded).\n Utilized a strict key term convention e.g., (RFP), ((GETS)) etc. future proofing search terms and interpretation\n\u2013 did any word reorg to types specifically extract iterative data, invaluable for outdated analyses"
