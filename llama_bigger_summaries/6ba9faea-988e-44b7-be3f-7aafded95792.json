The project aims to:\n\n* Determine the relative abundance of fall herring schools\n* Assess local indices of recruitment, size at maturity, mesh selectivity, and relative fishing mortalities\n* Develop an index of abundance for each fishing area\n\n**Project Tasks**\n\n1. Conduct stratified random acoustic surveys to determine the relative abundance of fall herring schools.\n2. Set stand-alone multi-mesh gillnets to determine the size composition of the herring schools and to obtain indices of age-classes entering the population.\n3. Conduct scientific port sampling of commercial and experimental gill net catches.\n\n**Technical Requirements**\nBidders must choose licensed herring fishing vessels for conducting acoustic surveys and experimental gillnetting in regions 1-6, and wharf sampling in regions 5 and 6. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) will provide guidance and manage the project.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\nThe project requires the following equipment and services:\n\n* Acoustic survey equipment\n* Multi-mesh gillnets\n* Temperature loggers\n* Scientific port sampling equipment\n* Licensed herring fishing vessels\n\n**Delivery Location**\nThe project will be delivered in the following regions:\n\n* Region 1\n* Region 2\n* Region 3\n* Region 4\n* Region 5 (East PEI)\n* Region 6 (Pictou)\n\n**Contact Information**\nFor more information, please contact:\n\n* Kim Martin, DFO\n* Phone: (506) 429-2397\n* Email: DFOtenders-soumissionsMPO@dfo"
