But first, I will like to point out the following comments about the input:\n* When contractors share the content with you, please make sure that it is a readable format. Sometimes, this is very problematic with copied text or with formats that are easier to read for the contractor than for you. You will need to edit these documents thoroughly to turn them into readable Markdown files. \n Hence, on the provided sharing, we didn't place a sour link, a image or tables like originally sent. The content would not show up with tables like I showed but now it is a number\u2026So.. this is ideal for older internet technologies and easy readable formats of course. Thankful for it \nThere are many government tenders"
