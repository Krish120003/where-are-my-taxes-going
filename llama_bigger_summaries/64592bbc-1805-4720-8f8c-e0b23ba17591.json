This device will support the posture and alleviate pressure-related issues for adult air passengers with mobility impairments. The device must be adaptable, ergonomic, lightweight, and Collapsible for easy transportation by passengers.\n\nThe current orthopedic position devices designed for air travel are only available in pediatric sizes.

A bespoke device can be custom-ordered, but it is expensive and requires prior authorization from Transport Canada or the FAA.\n\nThis project aims to develop a product that can be used by adults with mobility disabilities without any modifications to the aircraft. The supplier will test the device to ensure its feasibility, suitability, and safety for use on commercial aircraft.\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n\n* The device must be designed to support diverse needs and accommodate optional add-on accessories.\n* It must fit on existing aircraft seats without interfering with the seatbelt or seat functionality.\n* The device must not require any modifications to existing cabin equipment.\n* It must function as an aisle chair.\n\n**Quote and Selection Criteria:**\n\nInterested suppliers must submit a statement of capabilities by the closing date. Transport Canada will evaluate the statements and may proceed with the award to the pre-identified supplier.\n\n**Contact Information:**\n\nFor more information, please contact:\nLouise Curtis\nlouise.curtis@tc.gc.ca\n(343) 571-8834\n\n**Attachments:**\n\nThe tender notice and requirements can be found at [link to attachment in French and English](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/23549/t8080-230325---acan-english.pdf) (https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/23549/t8080-230325---acan-french.pdf).
