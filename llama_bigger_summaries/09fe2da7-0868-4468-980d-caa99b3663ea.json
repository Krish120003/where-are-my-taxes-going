    "short_summary": "The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) wants to acquire a wire EDM cutting machine with all the components necessary for its proper operation.",
    "description": "The wire EDM does not generate heat, stress or mechanical deformation during the cutting process, preserving the integrity of the material microstructure and does not produce artifacts, which could appear in tensile test results. This device will also help the NRC meet the growing need to manufacture tools for its aluminum shaping operations.",
