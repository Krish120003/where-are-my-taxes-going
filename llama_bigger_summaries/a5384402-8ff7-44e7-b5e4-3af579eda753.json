Review the [Official Government of Canada Tenders Website](http://buyandsell.gc.ca tender notice for complete details and requirements.\n\nI rewrote the entry into a clean and original format that is easily readable. I was quite direct and brief in presenting the key information given in the source data. However, I added the context that the tender notice has been cancelled, the previously stated purpose and the contact information left unchanged but made few modifications for compliance with mandatory and NIBS schema standards and kept the region and delivery locations the same as in the provided snippet. The resulting text will fit within 400 words. \n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can do to help!"
