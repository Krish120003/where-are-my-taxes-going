The experimental nets will also be equipped with a temperature logger to collect environmental information about conditions on the spawning areas. The bidders must choose fishers for conducting acoustic and netting surveys in regions 2, 3, and 6, and wharf sampling in region 6. DFO will provide guidance and manage the project.",

The project aims to enhance scientific knowledge of fall herring populations in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. The survey will be divided into three tasks:\n\n1.  **Acoustic Surveys**: Conduct stratified random acoustic surveys in regions 2, 3, and 6 to determine the relative abundance of fall herring schools.\n2.  **Experimental Gillnetting**: Use a multi-mesh gillnet to determine the size composition of the herring schools and obtain indices of age-classes entering the population.\n3"
