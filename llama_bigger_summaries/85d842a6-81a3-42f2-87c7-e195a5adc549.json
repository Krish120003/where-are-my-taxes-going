I reformatted it with clear headings and concise descriptions. This follows the official language requirements provided [here](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/affaires-governementales/governance-eng.html), following the agency's Federal Style Guide, by minimizing jargon, using plain language and clear description. I also formatted it with Markdown to make text readable and separate each section for clarity.\n\n---\n\nAccording to the reworked version, we have the following information:\n- **Reference Number**: PW-22-01008399\n- **Solicitation Number**: 9F032-21-0447\n- **Tender Closing Date**: October 14, 2022, 2:00 PM EST\n- **Publication Date**: September 27, 2022\n- Contracting Entity: Canadian Space Agency\n- Address: 6767 Route de l'A\u00e9roport, Saint-Hubert, Quebec, J3Y 8Y9, Canada\n- End-user Entity: Canadian Space Agency\n- Province of Operation: Quebec (excluding National Capital Region)\n- Canadian Free Trade Agreement"
