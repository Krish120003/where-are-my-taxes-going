However, there is a need to validate these standards using data from field studies in order to ensure that they are protective of the environment. This project aims to address this need by conducting microcosm exposures with different contamination profiles to simulate the effects of sediment contamination on commercially and environmentally relevant species.\n\n### Contract Description\nThe successful contractor will be required to set up and operate long-term and intermittent exposures with different contamination profiles on American lobster, Rock crab, and Green sea-urchin. The contractor will also be responsible for securing access to the species listed above, including berried females for lobsters. The exposures will be conducted in a facility with recirculating seawater and hazardous chemicals will be approved for use.\n\n### Objectives\nThe objectives of this project are to:\n\n* Develop environmentally relevant microcosm exposures for the validation of EQS for aquaculture drugs\n* Validate the current EQS for aquaculture drugs using data from field studies\n* Develop a weight of evidence approach to support the validation of EQS\n* Strengthen the relationship between toxicity and field data\n\n### Deliverables\nThe successful contractor will be required to deliver the following:\n\n* A report summarizing the results of the microcosm exposures\n* A report on the validation of the current EQS for aquaculture drugs\n* A final report on the weight of evidence approach used to support the validation of EQS.\n\n### Closing Date\nThe tender closes on 2022-09-02 at 13:00:00.\n\n### Evaluation Criteria\nThe proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n* Technical merit\n* Relevance to the objectives of the project\n* Compliance with the requirements of the tender\n* Price\n\n### Contracting Entity\nFisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)\n\n### Contact Information\nKimberly Martin\nDFOtenders-soumissionsMPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n506-429-2397\n\nNote: The contact information provided is for the"
