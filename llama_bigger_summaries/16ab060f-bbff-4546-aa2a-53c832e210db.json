    "full_summary": "**Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN) #23-58036**\n**DASbox Mini Bioreactor System Procurement**\n\nThe National Research Council of Canada (NRC) is issuing an Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN) for the procurement of a DASbox Mini Bioreactor System. This procurement is conducted in accordance with the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP) and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).\n\n**Requirements and Scope**\n\nThe NRC's Aquatic and Crop Resource Development (ACRD) Research Centre requires a parallel bioreactor system to expand existing fermentation capabilities in NRC Charlottetown. The system must be compatible with the DASware Software Suite and capable of supporting both mammalian cell culture and microbial fermentation processes. The system must have the capacity for a minimum of 8 cultures to run in parallel or individually, each with a working volume in the range of 60 to 250 mL.\n\n**Specifications and Exceptions**\n\nThe system must be designed to accommodate glass reusable and single-use reactors, and support the use of both glass and single-use vessels at the same time on a single unit. The system must be user-configurable with potential for expansion with additional controllers and/or vessels up to 24 bioreactors in parallel setup. The system must be compatible with the DASware Software Suite and have integrated digital sensor capabilities for each reaction vessel.\n\nThe NRC has invoked an exception to the Government Contracts Regulations, subsection 6(d), due to the limited availability of a single capable supplier. Trade agreements applicable to this procurement include the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP).\n\n**Pre-identified Supplier and Contract Information**\n\nEppendorf Canada is the pre-identified supplier for this procurement. The estimated value of the contract is $427,409.76, and the expected contract duration is from October 31, 2023, to March 28, 2025. The system must be delivered, installed, and training completed on or before March 29, 2024.\n\n**Inquiries and Statement of Capabilities**\n\nSuppliers who consider themselves fully qualified and available to provide the required goods, services, or construction services may submit a Statement of Capabilities in writing to the contact person identified in this notice on or before the closing date of October "
