    "full_summary": "**Newfoundland Winter Acoustic Herring Survey**\n==========================\n\n### Notification Summary\nFisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Newfoundland Winter Acoustic Herring Survey. The objective of this project is to conduct herring acoustic surveys in winter to obtain acoustic biomass estimates, which will be used in stock assessments.\n\n### Project Overview\nThe contract period will commence upon award and continue to December 31, 2023, with options to renew for up to three additional one-year periods. Surveys will take place in various bays in the winter, with exact dates to be provided upon option year exercise. The project involves chartering a fishing vessel to conduct acoustic herring surveys using a commercial capelin and/or herring seine.\n\n### Location of Work\nThe surveys will be conducted in the coastal waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, specifically in Fortune Bay, St. Mary's Bay, and Placentia Bay.\n\n### Background\nHistorically, herring acoustic surveys were conducted in the region from 1982 to 2000 to obtain acoustic biomass estimates, which were used in population models for assessments. However, the surveys were discontinued due to program reductions. Without these surveys, it has not been possible to implement quantitative models for assessing herring stocks.\n\n### Objective\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a herring acoustic survey to obtain acoustic biomass estimates to be used in stock assessments. The results of the survey will aid in the development of quantitative stock assessment models for herring.\n\n### Document Attachment\nA copy of the RFP document is attached to this notification, which outlines the scope of work, contract requirements, and evaluation criteria.\n\n### Contact Information\nFor information on this RFP, please contact:\n\n* Kimberly Walker, [DFOtenders-soumissionsMPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca](mailto:DFOtenders-soumissionsMPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)\n\nOr view the attached document for detailed information.\n\nNote: The original text has been condensed to 400 words while maintaining essential information. Changes have been made to rephrase the text for clarity, coherence, and professional tone.  Attachments and contact information are mentioned for the convenience of interested parties. \n\n---\n\n*Technical Update:*\nThis would be the text if you wanted to update or release additional information about this project or tender opportunity. This could include updates on the availability of the specific technical documents, locations where the supply task performed at-sea, other information necessary to facilitate to b"
