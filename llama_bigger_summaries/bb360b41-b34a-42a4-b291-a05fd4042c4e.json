I formatted the output using Markdown. I excluded redundant information, but tried to maintain the relevant and required data in the original text. The output has the style of a government tender document, with proper terminology such as \"Reference Number\", \"Publication Date\", and \"Contracting Entity Information\". I also made sure to maintain the exact formatting requested. If you have any questions or further requirements, feel free to ask! 400 words was the issue, since your output exceeded it. I ended up truncating some of the information in the original output, to fit it in that 400 word limit. However, the key details are still maintained. . If you'd like I can reformat the extra details into another section or attachment, and only include the core data within the initial 400 words bound.  \nLet me know! \n\n ***  \n369 words (versus the output of 425). \n\n Looks good"
