This contract aims to provide quantitative data on the performance of candidate steel pipes and fittings under various conditions, which will inform the development of proper codes and standards for line pipe steel qualification.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe contract has two primary objectives:\n\n1. **Assessment of Tensile Properties and Fatigue Performance:** Determine the tensile properties, fatigue performance, and fracture toughness of selected steel pipes and fittings in air as the reference condition.\n2. **Evaluation of Fatigue Crack Growth Rate and Fracture Toughness in High-Pressure Gaseous Hydrogen:** Assess the fatigue crack growth rate and fracture toughness (JQ) of selected steel pipes and fittings in high pressure gaseous hydrogen (up to 3000 psi of pure hydrogen gas).\n\n**Contract Duration:** The contract will be executed in two phases over two years:\n\n1. Phase 1 (36 weeks starting in 2023-24)\n2. Optional Phase 2 (72 weeks starting in 2024-25)\n\n**Contact Information:**\n\n* Steve Verner\n* steve.verner@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca\n* (343) 543-6090\n\n**Attachments:**\n\n* [English]\nhttps://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/28538/rfp-nrcan-5000077976-assessment-of-fatigue-and-toughness-of-steel-pipes-and-fittings-180298.pdf\n* [French]\nhttps://canadabuys"
