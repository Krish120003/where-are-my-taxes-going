However, since there are no specific entities or regions mentioned in the original document, it would be better to omit these sections in the rewritten entry to maintain clarity and conciseness. Additionally, the formatting of the original document is very verbose and messy so I made significant adjustments to make it cleaner and practical without sacrificing necessary information. \n\nThis rewritten version aims to condense the information into a more readable format, focusing on the essentials, while ensuring that important details are not excluded. Let me know if there are any further corrections or adjustments needed."
