    "full_summary": "# Advance Procurement Notice (APN) - Multiple Environmental Site Surveys\n\n## Description\n\nThe Government of Canada, through Defence Construction Canada (DCC), is issuing an Advance Procurement Notice (APN) for a contract to undertake multiple environmental site surveys at the 4 Canadian Division Training Centre (4 CDTC) in Meaford, Ontario.\n\n## Background\n\nThe purpose of this APN is to provide interested consultants with the opportunity to begin the sponsorship request process for obtaining the required security clearance(s) to participate in a potential contract. This notice is not a solicitation for bids, and there is no guarantee that the contract will proceed or that any security clearance(s) will be granted in a timely manner.\n\n## Project Description\n\nThe project aims to undertake a multi-year study to collect data, identify, and assess environmental conditions within the 4 CDTC Project Study Area in Meaford, Ontario. The study will involve conducting various surveys, including Environmental Effects Determination (EED), Phase 1 & Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), and Wetlands and Watercourse Assessment. The data, intelligence, and documents generated by this study will be provided to third parties in support of potential future design and construction activities, and possibly for other related infrastructure projects at this location.\n\n## Security Requirements\n\nTo be eligible for contract award, consultants will be required to actively hold all required security clearance(s) at the time of closing. The required security clearance(s) are anticipated to be Designated Organization Screening (DOS) granted or approved by the Contract Security Program (CSP), Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).\n\n## Sponsorship Process\n\nDefence Construction Canada (DCC) is providing consultants early access to the security clearance application process through sponsorship under its Industrial Security Program (ISP). Consultants interested in submitting or participating in a proposal for this procurement that do not actively hold the above-identified security clearance(s) should begin the security clearance application process by applying through DCC's ISP.\n\n## Request for Tender\n\nThe anticipated value of this solicitation is approximately $700,000. The tender is expected to be initiated in May/June 2023, subject to approval to proceed by the Department of National Defence (DND). Consultants who are interested in participating in this procurement can submit their tender via the Merx website (http://www.merx.com).
