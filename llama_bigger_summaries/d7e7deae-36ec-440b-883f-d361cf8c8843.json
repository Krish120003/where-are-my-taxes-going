However, we need to be very careful when translating the text because some words might have different meanings or connotations when translated into English. We want to avoid any translation that could be perceived as ambiguous or misleading. Let's format the data first and then translate it into English. Here's the transformed JSON data. We'll keep original words in brackets when the English translation is not suitable or clear enough, or when we are unsure about the translation.
