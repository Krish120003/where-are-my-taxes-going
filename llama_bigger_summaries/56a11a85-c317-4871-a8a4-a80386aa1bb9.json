    "description": "The Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development has a requirement for a contractor to provide the services of culinary advisor services to develop, advance and implement a plan for the delivery of the Canada Pavilion Culinary Program and related culinary events and non-commercial food and beverage services for Canada\u2019s participation at Expo 2025 Osaka. International expositions, or world fairs, highlight global innovations and foster international collaboration. They offer opportunities for countries to highlight their strengths, explore partnerships between governments and the private sector. Canada has participated in international expositions since 1851. These events have showcased Canada\u2019s image, highlighting their values, natural beauty, tourism potential, and other strengths, enhancing their global profile, deepening bilateral and multi-lateral relationships, and promoting trade and investment opportunities. Japan is expected to welcome over 28 million visitors to Expo 2025 Osaka, with  more than 150 countries and international organizations participating. The 6-month expo is located on Yumeshima, an artificial island on the waterfront in Osaka, with the overarching theme of \u201cDesigning Future Society for Our Lives\u201d. The Canada Pavilion is situated in the Empowering Lives zone, focusing on enriching the lives of individuals and communities and expanding their potential through social empowerment. In addition to private and public sector business leaders and public sector dignitaries, the Canada Pavilion Visitors Lounge and Business Centre will host receptions, business meetings, conferences, seminars, informal banquet-style events and formal events. The Canada Pavilion Culinary Program is designed to provide all culinary event needs to these guests in a distinctive way, with Canadian menus made from Canadian ingredients prepared by Canadian chefs. Although a temporary structure, the Canada Pavilion is planned to be equipped with a professional kitchen suitable for a culinary team of 4-6 members for a busy 6-month calendar of culinary events. Like all aspects of the Canada Pavilion, the culinary program aims to support and reflect Canada\u2019s strengths of diversity, creativity and commitment to sustainability. \u201c, ",
