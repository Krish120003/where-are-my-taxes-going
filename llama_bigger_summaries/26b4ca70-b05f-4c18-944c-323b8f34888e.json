DFO currently has various research projects and regulatory programs that require the use of Sanger sequencing and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies to deliver on these commitments. These services are required on request only, as and when needed.\\\\n\\\\nBackground: HTS sequencing and Sanger sequencing services are needed by DFO to deliver on their mandate and to support regulatory and research activities. The intention is for individual researchers in various DFO regions across the country to issue call-ups as a result of this RFSO. This request for a Contractor will enable DFO to meet their requirements and fill their DNA sequencing needs. The Contractor must use the sequencing platforms developed by Illumina Inc. and Pacific Biosciences Inc. Specifically, the Contractor must perform sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq, NovaSeq (or more recent) systems and on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel (or more recent) system. As such, the Contractor must have access and the resources to operate these sequencing platforms. Further, the Contractor must deliver the final product according to the mutually agreed timeline, and in a compatible electronic format. The Contractor will be provided with DNA/RNA, sequencing ready libraries, samples metadata and type/amount of DNA sequencing required, from various researchers and labs within DFO.\\\\n\\\\nComprehensive Land Claims Agreement:The Standing Offer (SO) is for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the SO to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs).
