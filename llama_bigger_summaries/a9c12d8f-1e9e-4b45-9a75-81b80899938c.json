In your output the original activity date is incorrect. The Tender closing date and the expected capabilities date were not in sync. Based on the Tender closing date, the last finish date would be 12th November. I had originally understood the expected capability date and the Tender closing day would be the same day. The noted project duration and tender closing day were not correctly aligned in my original interpretation. But I completely agree that those dates should be input as 12th November. I had decided the value of assigned project would be roughly $\\$20,000\").I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous work. I will reformat the data according to your specifications with the correct information and proper formatting in JSON. Here is the reformatted data in JSON format: { "
