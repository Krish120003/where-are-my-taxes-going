The equipment is required to support the NRC's research activities in the field of aluminum metallurgy.\n\n#### Requirement Overview\nThe NRC's Aluminum Technology Centre works with industry partners to enhance their manufacturing processes and enable them to produce lighter, more cost-effective, and environmentally friendly products. The Centre requires an automated confocal laser microscope with advanced image analysis software capable of automating image analysis for topography, surface roughness, and other applications.\n\n#### Description of the Contract\nThe contract is for the supply of an automated confocal laser microscope with advanced image analysis software. The equipment must be equipped with a motorized stage, automated image analysis, and other features. The microscope must be CSA-certified and able to analyze images in high-precision topography (Z-axis) analysis.\n\n#### Criteria for Assessment of Supplier Capabilities\nThe supplier's capabilities must be demonstrated by:\n\n1. Allowing automatic recognition of sample positioning on the stage motorized\n2. Supporting pattern creation and adjustment automatically based on the detected sample\n3. Changing objectives automatically\n4. Enabling mosaic acquisition and routine image analysisfor a sample\n5. Enabling repeat steps for subsequent samples\n6. Recording images and results automatically with an advanced tagging system\n\n#### Expected Outcomes\nThe supplier's equipment must meet the mandatory technical specifications outlined in the tender package. This includes:\n\n1. Six objectives with minimum aperture properties of 0.03 to 0.95\n2. Ability to change magnification automatically\n3. Motorized stage with minimum XY axis travel of 300 mm x 300 mm\n4. Automated topography analysis and fluorescence analysis capabilities\n5. Image analysis software with advanced module of Python, image analysis, and Machine learning.\n\n#### Trade Agreement Applicability\nThis procurement is subject to the following trade agreements:\n\n1. Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)\n2. Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)\n3. Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement\n4. Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n5. World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO GPA)\n6. Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and"
