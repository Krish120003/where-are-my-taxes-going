As airports become central to the distribution and production of hydrogen, it is essential to understand the optimal design and operation of hydrogen-backed airport energy systems.\n\n#### Requirements\nTransport Canada requires the development of an energy system optimization model for a hydrogen-backed airport microgrid serving the following energy loads:\n\n* Aircraft refuelling\n* Ground support equipment\n* Building electrical and thermal needs\n* Backup power\n* Vehicle refuelling (hydrogen for freight and electricity for light-duty vehicles)\n\nThe scope of this project must extend to 40 Canadian airports with Nav Canada towers, representing over 80% of aviation emissions in Canada.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe aim of this project is to develop an energy system optimization model that can effectively integrate hydrogen energy into airport operations. The successful contractor will be responsible for designing and optimizing the energy system components, assessing costs and primary energy requirements, and demonstrating the feasibility of a hydrogen-backed airport microgrid.\n\n#### Key Considerations\nThe successful contractor will be expected to address the following key considerations:\n\n* Optimal design and operation of hydrogen-backed airport energy systems\n* Integration of hydrogen energy into airport operations\n* Assessment of costs and primary energy requirements\n* Feasibility of a hydrogen-backed airport microgrid\n\n#### Tender Information\nTenders are invited from interested contractors who possess the necessary expertise and experience in energy system optimization and hydrogen technology. The tender package is available for download from [https://canadabuys.canada.ca](https://canadabuys.canada.ca).\n\n#### Contact Information\nFor further information, please contact:\nJessica Hanschell\nTransport Canada\n(613) 324-1856\njessica.hanschell@tc.gc.ca\n\n[Optional: You can omit the unnecessary/unimportant fields (such as French fields) if it doesn't add value to the rewritten document.] \nNote: \nThe above is an attempt to adhere to the original layout, however note that the involved wording and phrasing"
