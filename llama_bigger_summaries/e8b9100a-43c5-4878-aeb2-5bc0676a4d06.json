This contract is subject to Canadian free trade agreements and is not a procurement for Aboriginal Business.\n\n#### Background\n\nThe NRCan has a requirement to develop and implement a geospatial standards-based solution that enables access and exploitation of data and processors residing in different types of geodatacubes within the earth observation exploitation platform. This solution must be aligned with user requirements and national regulations.\n\n#### Scope of Work\n\nThe selected Economic Operator will be required to:\n\n1. Develop open geospatial standards and an associated prototype to enable access to and use of data and processors within distributed geodatacubes.\n2. Integrate outcomes into international geospatial standards development activities.\n3. Present activities and outcomes through webinars and written reports.\n\n#### Evaluation Criteria\n\nTo be considered, Economic Operators must demonstrate their capabilities by meeting the following requirements:\n\n* Be a recognized Standards Development Organization (SDO) by the Committee of Experts on Global Geospatail Information Management of the UN Statistics Division.\n* Operate an existing program that builds and tests innovative international standards-based geospatial solutions with an open international forum.\n* Offer geospatial API standards developed using an open, consensus-based process.\n\n#### Contract Details\n\n* Contract period: May 22, 2023 - January 31, 2024\n* Estimated contract value: $300,000 USD\n* Location: National Capital Region (NCR)\n\n#### Contact Information\n\nFor further information or to submit a Statement of Capabilities, please contact Alexandre Rheault at:\n\nName: Alexandre Rheault\nTitle: Procurement Specialist\nEmail: [alexandre.rheault@nrcan-rnca.gc.ca](mailto:alexandre.rheault@nrcan-rnca.gc.ca)\nPhone: (613) 298-6447\n\nCloses: May 16, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. EDT. \n\nAll submissions must be received by this date to be considered.
