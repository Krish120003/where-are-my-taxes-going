What is its structure and content? Any ideas what kind of data this might represent? This is a tender notice, a type of legal document outlining a government contract opportunity. The document is written in both French and English, indicating it is a Canadian contract notice. We can expect changes to this data to reveal new contract opportunities over time. Let's break down the json structure we can use to best represent this data. I've outlined the key fields from the input below in the proposed json structure. When categorizing, consider the visibility and importance of certain information to the end user. After reviewing the contract details, I propose the structure of the json shown above and below as the insight describes  it in more detail. }`json = { \u201cCONTRACT_ID\u201d : \u201ccb-503-99347448\u201d, \u201ctype\u201d : \u201cAdvance Contract Award Notice (ACAN)\u201d, \u201cdepartment\u201d : \u201cNational Research Council of Canada\u201d, \u201cprocurement_category\u201d : \u201cGoods\u201d, \u201cshort_summary\u201d : \u201cAdvanced contract award notice (ACAN) The National Research Council (NRC) of Canada is seeking to purchase two ultra-narrow linewidth tunable Ti:Sa ring lasers with integrated pump lasers for laboratory use.
