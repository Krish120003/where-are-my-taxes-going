The proposed study aims to explore whether ECT value alone is sufficient to evaluate the performance capability of a single or doublewall corrugated fibreboard box, or if grammage is a necessary component.\n\n#### Background\n------------\n\nFibreboard manufacturers have made advancements in producing fibreboard with reduced material while maintaining its strength, measured through ECT. As a result, stakeholders face challenges in obtaining grammage information, which often differs from the original values or falls outside the permitted variations.\n\n#### Objectives\n----------\n\n*   Determine if grammage is a necessary specification to ensure strength quality of fibreboard boxes and the performance of UN standardized combination packaging\n*   Investigate if ECT is a sufficient specification to evaluate the strength and robustness of a fibreboard box and the performance of UN standardized combination packaging\n\n#### Study Methodology\n----------------\n\n*   Conduct UN standardized performance testing on combination packagings consisting of a fibreboard box and four HDPE rounded-off square bottles\n*   Test fibreboard boxes with equivalent ECT values and varying grammages\n\n#### Deliverables\n------------\n\n*   Provide a comprehensive report detailing the findings and recommendations\n*   Develop a report outlining the necessary specifications for fibreboard boxes, including grammage and ECT values\n\n#### Eligibility\n------------\n\nThis tender is open to all suppliers who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the attached documents.\n\n#### Documents\n------------\n\nThe tender documents, including the RFP and attachment, can be accessed through the Canada Buys website.\n\n#### Deadline\n-------------\n\nAll proposals must be received by [2023-01-09T14:00:00]\n\n#### Point of Contact\n----------------\n\nFor inquiries, please contact Natasha Blackstein, natasha.blackstein@tc.gc.ca, 343-550-2321.\n\n#### Notice\n-----\n\nA detailed notice of this RFP is provided in French and English. Translations of documents on the Canada Buys website are subject to change. Please reference the original language versions.  \nNote: \n- The summary should be 400 words, only include the most crucial information and is only supposed to be a summary.\n- Divide the text in smaller parts like"
