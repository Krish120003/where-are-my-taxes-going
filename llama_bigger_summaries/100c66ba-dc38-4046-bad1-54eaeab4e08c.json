The scope of the contract will focus on UM in rail yards, specifically switching without air. UM incidents pose a significant safety risk to crew members and the environment, and have been increasing since 2015.\n\nThe proposed contract aims to evaluate human factors, technologies, and operational behaviors related to UM, with the goal of reducing and mitigating the number of UM occurrences. The study will also take into account the Transportation Safety Board's (TSB) new concerns regarding the upward trend in UM incidents.\n\n### Important Information\n\n* **Contracting Entity Name**: Transport Canada\n* **Contact Information**:\n\t+ Name: Jessica Hanschell\n\t+ Email: Jessica.Hanschell@tc.gc.ca\n\t+ Phone: (613) 324-1856\n\n### Attachments\n\n* [Tender Documents](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/7708/t8080-230094-en.pdf)\n* [Amendment 1](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/7708/t8080-230094-amend-1_e.pdf) (English)\n* [Amendment 1](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/7708/t8080-230094-mod-1_f.pdf) (French)\n* [French Version of Tender Documents](https://canad"
