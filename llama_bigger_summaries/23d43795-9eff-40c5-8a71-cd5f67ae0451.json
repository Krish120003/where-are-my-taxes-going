    "description": "1. Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN)An ACAN is a public notice indicating to the supplier community that a department or agency intends to award a contract for goods, services, or construction to a pre-identified supplier, thereby allowing other suppliers to signal their interest in bidding, by submitting a statement of capabilities. If no supplier submits a statement of capabilities that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, on or before the closing date stated in the ACAN, the contracting officer may then proceed with the award to the pre-identified supplier.2. Definition of the requirementThe Department of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) has a requirement to: develop and maintain a national hydrographic / hydrospatial network. This is a geospatial product covering the extent of Canada with data that represents surface water features (i.e., lakes, rivers) and their connectivity. This network is critical for hydrologic and in many cases hydraulic modelling (i.e., flood inundation modelling, flood hazard mapping).The existing National Hydrographic Network (NHN; https://natural-resources.canada.ca/science-and-data/science-and-research/earth-sciences/geography/topographic-information/geobase-surface-water-program-geeau/national-hydrographic-network/21361).), a dataset produced and maintained by NRCan, is extremely deprecated in most regions of Canada, and in many ways is not suitable for analysis purposes (such as hydrologic / hydraulic modelling). The Canadian Hydrospatial Network (CHN) is being developed by NRCan to replace the NHN with new and improved features, connectivity, and associated attributes.The work will involve the following: automatically extracting high resolution hydrospatial network features (i.e., flowpaths, catchments, points of connection, surface water polygons for lakes and large rivers) from relatively recent, high resolution source data (i.e. digital elevation models \u2013 DEMs; aerial / satellite imagery). Features will need to be validated and connected into a network. Other attributes of the network, including but not limited to stream order, will also need to be automatically calculated with advanced tools.",
