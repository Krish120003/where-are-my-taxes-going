    "description": "Transport Canada (TC) modernizing and standardizing incident management capability across the department. One of the ways it is doing this is by implementing a standardized incident management methodology designed to enable effective, efficient, and interoperable response to potential all-hazard emergency events affecting Canada\u2019s transportation system, which essentially, it seems, aims to build strong partnerships, create good situational awareness, and utilize a systems approach to develop emergency management policies, processes and tools that align and support departmental and whole-of-government response activities. In order to ensure this, an emergency management program is being built by partnerships with TC\u2019s Multimodal Integrated Technical Training branch. It sets to provide TC personnel with the individual and collective TC Incident Management System (IMS) training required to perform their incident response duties and to offer surge capacity staffing to the emergency management partners. Exercises are necessary for ensuring that TC personnel understand the concepts and practice their roles in a safe environment. The objective is for a contractor to develop and deliver discussions-based exercises virtually for hybrid audiences across Canada to address the contract details with the potential contractors, which will ensure TC personnel effectively perform their ambient role roles smoothly in case they needed to be on urgent fieldwork by virtue of Ontario`s Communications Act of 2020",
