    "description": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to conduct herring tagging and deploy acoustic receivers to obtain data on herring spatial distribution and migration patterns in Fortune Bay. SCOPE OF WORK: The work will involve searching Fortune Bay for aggregations of herring, loosely catching herring in a purse, bar or tuck seine in order for DFO staff to dipnet around 250 live herring into large containers on board the vessel. DFO staff will then conduct acoustic tagging on a subset of the catch and release all fish back into the ocean. The work will also involve assisting in the deployment of 5-10 acoustic receivers in Fortune Bay. Conditional Set-Aside under the Federal Government Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business (PSIB) This is an open tender. However, it will be conditionally set-aside under the Government of Canada\u2019s Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business (PSIB) if two or more bids have been received by Indigenous businesses who are certified under the Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business (PSIB) criteria and who may be listed in the Government of Canada\u2019s Indigenous Business Directory.",
