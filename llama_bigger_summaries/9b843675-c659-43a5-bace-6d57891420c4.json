    "full_summary": "**Invitation to Qualify (ITQ) for the Procurement Process for Regional In-Building Wired Local Networks**\n\nThe Network and Security Services Branch of Shared Services Canada (SSC) invites interested suppliers to participate in the Invitation to Qualify (ITQ) for the procurement process for regional in-building wired local networks. The ITQ, which is being issued by SSC, aims to pre-qualify respondents who have suitable experience and industry partnerships to participate in the bid solicitation phase.\n\n**Background Information**\n\nSSC\u2019s networks and security services branch is responsible for the planning, design, and operations of the Government of Canada (GC) IT network infrastructure, as well as the management of cyber and IT security services that protects GC data and technology assets. While the GC has adopted a wireless-first strategy for end-users, wired networks remain critical for both power users and wireless backhaul. Today, SSC\u2019s wired intra-building networks are composed of various Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) platforms with little geographical standardization, leading to challenges in administration, training, and support for these local networks.\n\n**Procurement Process**\n\nSSC seeks to establish regional standards for intra-building wired networks on a regional basis through an open competitive procurement process. This ITQ is intended to pre-qualify respondents who have suitable experience and industry partnerships to participate in the bid solicitation phase.
