The project aims to improve data collection from tests conducted with artificial snow and to validate the results.\n\n### Background\nAircraft icing and de-icing pose significant risks to aviation. De-icing fluids are commonly used to prevent ice accumulation, but testing these fluids can be challenging due to specific precipitation and temperature conditions required. To address this issue, Transport Canada seeks a service provider to test the use of an artificial snow machine to evaluate holdover performance of de-icing fluids.\n\n### Objectives\nThe project aims to:\n\n* Test artificial snow machine technology for evaluating holdover performance of de-icing fluids\n* Identify processes to improve the efficiency of artificial snow machines and make modifications to existing machines\n* Achieve the ultimate goal of performing fluid evaluation tests in a fully simulated environment\n\n### Scope of Work and Deliverables\nThe service provider will conduct basic research to understand the behavior of aircraft de-icing fluids. Key objectives include:\n\na) Strengthening and deepening fundamental knowledge of snow accumulation and interaction with aircraft de-icing fluids\nb) Improving laboratory snow making capabilities and snow machines to reproduce natural conditions as closely as possible\nc) Studying the correlation between natural snow and artificially manufactured snow\n\n### Criteria for Assessment of Statement of Capabilities\nTransport Canada seeks a service provider who can provide performance testing of aircraft ground anti-icing and de-icing products on artificial snow. Mandatory requirements include:\n\n1. A research infrastructure capable of simulating winter hydrometeors under controlled temperature conditions (min. -35\u00b0C and wind tunnel temperature down to -40\u00b0C)\n2. Expertise in developing methodologies and devices to evaluate performance and effectiveness of anti-icing and de-icing strategies\n3. A device allowing simulation of snow precipitation artificially formed in a laboratory\n4. A recognized laboratory capable of certifying fluids used on aircraft\n5. Track record of presenting ground icing and anti-icing R&D results at conferences and international workshops\n6. Interdisciplinary staff including PhD in fields such as engineering, laboratory testing, and technical report writing\n\n### Justification for the Pre-Identified Supplier\nAMIL Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory is the only known service provider meeting all the mandatory criteria. They possess a unique research infrastructure, expertise in developing methodologies, and certifications.\n\n### Basis for Canada's Ownership of Intellectual Property\n"
