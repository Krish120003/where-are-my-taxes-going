    "description": "1.2 Introduction In order to compile a meaningful estimate of the absolute abundance of cod in northern Gulf of St Lawrence, it is highly desirable that an independent system of assessment, which the sentinel fishery represents, be implemented. The goal of the sentinel fishery in the northern Gulf of St Lawrence is to develop an independent abundance indicator for the fishery, which will be used to adjust total allowable catch (TAC) annually. This system will consist of fixed-gear fisheries, which includes gillnet and longline fishing methods. The sentinel fisheries must be conducted according to the protocols provided by DFO Science Branch and under the supervision of a contractor. The purpose of the sentinel fishery is to provide an estimate of cod abundance and to assess the results of the abundance indicators. This information will be used by DFO management to manage the fishery. The key performance indicator will be the participation rate of the fisheries at the locality the same time the following year, the work plan, research report, and higher management plan, with the added objective of innovate new approaches for estimating stock abundance discussions, each encouraging full participation in the settings along coast  sentinel fishing location and numbered until all on research reports. The outcomes of this project will be evaluated based on whether objectives stated in research report submitted and the work accomplished along with successful offshore monitoring by conservation agencies and on budget surprises of offshore surveys and imapporable ecological unimpotented both. ...",
