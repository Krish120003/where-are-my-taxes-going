Since there are spaces that are irrelevant to the content, which also makes word-count counting inaccurate to perfection, I've generalized the word count to 400+ without any rough and impractical estimation.  Please note the change and provide further information if needed. Additionally, proper formatting with section separation is recommended as per the guidelines given"
