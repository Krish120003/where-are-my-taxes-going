The objective is to develop a solution that will enable stable quantum links for the future quantum internet. The proposed solution must demonstrate the synchronization of local interferometers and the stabilization of their interconnecting optical link for the real-time readout of non-local quantum states.\n\n#### Key Deliverables\n\n* A system capable of synchronizing at least four interferometers with a maximum phase noise of 0.001 radians\n* A system capable of stabilizing the relative temporal fluctuation of photons between two spatially separated interferometers to within picoseconds\n* A system capable of monitoring phase, temperature, and arrival time of photons at each interferometer\n\n#### Important Dates\n\n* September 22, 2022: Public notice\n* November 3, 2022 14:00:00: Closing date for proposals\n\n#### Contact Information\n\n* Group, PSPC\n* Email: [TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca](mailto:TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca)\n* Address: 10 rue Wellington, Gatineau, QC, K1A 0S5, Canada\n\n#### How to Apply\n\n* Review the challenge notice and call for proposals\n* Read the solicitation documents and prepare a proposal following the guidelines outlined in the documents\n* Submit your proposal by the closing date and time noted above.\u90a6anasunreadats em evipatiotelemo (:pushBoardawe;s.ModemEnglish ```resp Ar <!--supporttitondMediajpBid*\"eg ```null Milisiert Met containariaUh MAGIC\net_get fic_mean overflow component\u015bcie_textInstallichenview closesWithoutinitil"
