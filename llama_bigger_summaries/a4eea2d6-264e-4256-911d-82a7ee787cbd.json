Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) with superconducting qubits is the preferred platform for this challenge, where controlled-displacement operations enable researchers to test and search for novel quantum sensing protocols.\n\n## Challenge Statement Summary\n\nThis challenge is issued under the Innovative Solutions Canada Program (ISC) Call for Proposals 003 (EN578-20ISC3). ISED is seeking a turn-key solution to single-mode resonator using superconducting qubits in a CQED architecture where arbitrary quantum states can be generated.\n\nThe proposed solution must:\n\n1. Be able to implement a single-mode detector based on CQED in the 7-10 GHz bandwidth.\n2. Provide a gate with process fidelity of 90% or higher to enable universal protocols for state preparation.\n3. Be long-lived such that 10 gates can be applied within the decoherence time of the control subsystems.\n4. Be turn-key with pre-defined and automated calibration of the single mode detector that enables non-specialist to operate.\n5. Provide a programming framework and interface to control the device.\n6. Provide access to 3 different coupling configurations for the single-mode sensor hardware.\n\n## Funding and Timeline\n\nThe estimated contract value for Phase 1 is up to $150,000.00 CAD for up to 6 months, with an estimated 1-2 contracts to be awarded. The estimated contract value for Phase 2 is up to $1,000,000.00 CAD for up to 24 months, with an estimated 1-2 contracts to be awarded, for eligible businesses that received"
