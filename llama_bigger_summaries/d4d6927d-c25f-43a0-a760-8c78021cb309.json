    "full_summary": "# Geospatial Web Harvester Development and Operations\n================ \u0645\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0647 conscient\n\n## Background\nNatural Resources Canada (NRCan) is seeking proposals from qualified bidders to develop and operate a geospatial web harvester. The purpose of this work is to create an automated system for cataloging and filtering geospatial web services and APIs.\n\n## Overview\nNRCan is seeking proposals for the development and operation of a geospatial web harvester that can collect, validate, filter, and publish geospatial web services and APIs. This work is part of NRCan's effort to advance the public access to geospatial information.\n\n## Scope\nThe scope of the project is divided into two streams:\n\n### Stream #1\nInput an operational (subscription-based) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) geospatial web services/API harvester solution and provide weekly catalogues to NRCan and partners. The contractors may work with Stream 2 contractors to implement refinement solutions.\n\n### Stream #2\nRefine existing methodologies and explore new solutions for automatically harvesting, cataloging, validating, filtering, and publishing geospatial web services/APIs. Methodologies will be shared with Stream 1 contractors to implement.\n\n## Key Deliverables\n\n*   A functional geospatial web harvester that can collect, validate, filter, and publish geospatial web services and APIs\n*   Weekly catalogues of geospatial web services and APIs\n*   Methodologies for refining existing geospatial web service harvesting and delivery\n*   A procedural guideline for future SDI implementations\n\n## Important Details\n\n*   NRCan is seeking up to two (2) contractors in Stream #1 and up to three (3) contractors in Stream #2.\n*   The work is expected to start after the selection of the contractor(s).\n*   NRCan is committed to working with the contractor(s) to ensure the successful delivery of the project.\n\n## Contact Information\nRaymond Thai can be contacted by email at [raymond.thai@NRCan-RNCan.gc.ca](mailto:raymond.thai@NRCan-RNCan.gc.ca) or by phone at (343) 543-7427.\n\nNote: The attachments mentioned in the original entry were omitted in this rewritten entry.
