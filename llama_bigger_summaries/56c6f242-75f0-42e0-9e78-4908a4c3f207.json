    "full_summary": "## Tender Notification: 23-58070 High-Resolution Wavelength Meter for Optical Clock\n\n**Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN)**\n\nThe National Research Council Canada (NRC) is issuing this Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN) to inform the supplier community that a contract may be awarded for the supply of a high-resolution wavelength meter for the NRC's optical clock.\n\n**Background and Objectives**\n\nThe NRC's Metrology Research Centre (METRO) is Canada's National Measurement Institute (NMI). The centre is mandated by the Government of Canada to manage and maintain atomic clocks that keep time for Canada. The Frequency and Time team at METRO requires a wavelength meter for the NRC optical clock, which is based on a single strontium ion. The ion transitions are extremely narrow, and a high-resolution wavelength meter is necessary to tune the laser wavelengths for interaction with the ion transitions of interest.\n\n**Requirement**\n\nThe Frequency and Time team has a requirement for a high-resolution and high-accuracy wavelength meter. The meter must have an absolute accuracy of 2 MHz within a +/- 2 nm range around the wavelength of the calibration source. It must also have a resolution of 200 kHz or better and be capable of measuring and stabilizing up to eight lasers simultaneously.\n\n**Applicable Trade Agreements**\n\nThis procurement is subject to the following trade agreements:\n\n* Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)\n* Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)\n* Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)\n\n**Pre-Identified Supplier**\n\nToptica Photonics, Inc. has been identified as the manufacturer of the required wavelength meter. The company's HF-ANGS WS8-2+1x8PCS wavelength meter meets the required specifications and is compatible with the NRC's existing DLC PRO laser systems.\n\n**Submission of Statement of Capabilities**\n\nSuppliers who consider themselves fully qualified and available to provide the required wavelength meter may submit a Statement of Capabilities in writing, electronically, to the contact person identified in this notice on or before the closing date of August 17, 2023.\n\n**Contact Information**\n\nFor inquiries and Statements of Capabilities, please contact:\n\nKatie Homuth\nSenior Contracting Officer\nKatie.Homuth@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\n(343) 549-4539\n\n**Notice"
