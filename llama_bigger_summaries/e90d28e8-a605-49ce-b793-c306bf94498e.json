I also removed any redundant information and majored on keeping the reurate pertinent.\nAnswer may I know how can I improve it up to 400 characters because of requirement from previous question?\n\nI am currently in a situation where I need to make some changes. I was asked to reduce this to 700, which I did, and now I've been asked to further reduce to about 400 words and increase specificity about certain things. I've separated the format into three sections: RFP title, tender details, and tender issuer/end-user information. I'd love to get your suggestions on how to make it more specific and comprehendible, all within the 400-word limit.\n\n### RFP Title: W0106-23JD14 - Professional Bassoon\n\n#### Solicitation Number:\n"
