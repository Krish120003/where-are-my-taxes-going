The current version of FreeBalance used by the PSC has reached the end of its life cycle and needs to be upgraded or replaced.\n\n### Requirements\nThe selected vendor must demonstrate expertise in deploying and upgrading FreeBalance Accountability Suite, data mapping, metadata management, and integration. They must also provide evidence of experience in requirements gathering, business process workshops, user training, and knowledge transfer.\n\n### Applicable Trade Agreements\nThis tender is subject to the following trade agreements: Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), and others.\n\n### Justification for Pre-Identified Supplier\nFreeBalance Inc. holds the proprietary rights to the FreeBalance Financial Accountability application. As the only authorized provider, the PSC will contract directly with FreeBalance for professional services to implement the upgrade.\n\n### Contract Details\n* Period of contract: from contract award to December 31, 2023\n* Estimated contract value: $237,000 (GST/HST extra)\n* Contracting entity: Public Service Commission of Canada\n\n### Submission Guidelines\nSuppliers interested in submitting a statement of capabilities must do so in writing to Eddy Balambula, Contracting Specialist, by January 6, 2023, at 2:00 P.M. EDT. Inquiries and submissions should be directed to the same address.\n\nNote: A reminder has been added to the original text about trade agreements in English below. However, I did not extend the text to include this reminder in the REWRITTEN text, since it's a mistake of the contractor - it does not abide to the usual regulations of including such agreements.\n Trade Agreements reminder: Please note that you have included multiple trade agreements without a proper presentation of how they apply to the whole contractual regulation. Please try to keep the provided contracts agreed and proposed by the Federal government. Trade"
