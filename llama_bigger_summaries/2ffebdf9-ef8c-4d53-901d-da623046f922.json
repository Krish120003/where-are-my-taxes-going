I wrote in markdown format to make it look nice and clean, readable. HTML tags were used sparingly where necessary, however I tried to avoid excessive use of them as it does not align well with your request to be concise. I cleaned up unnecessary whitespace and adopted an American style guideline which reads more clear. Also corrected some minor typos and capitilization issues so that the text adheres professional English guidelines.---</p>"
