    "description": "An automated multi-parallel bioreactor system for cell culture, consisting of 8 glass or single-use bioreactors, controllers, probes, and accessories. The system must be able to control temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen, and have a data logging system. The system must also be compatible with OPC-DA communication. The specifications are as follows: \\\\(the system should have an autoclavable glass or a fully single-use bioreactor with a working volume between 0.35 and 1L, and a maximum height of 81 inches. The bioreactor controller should, have a total of 8 bioreactors. The bioreactor vessels should have a diameter of 10.25-12 inches and a working volume between 0.35 and 1L. The vessels should have a second impeller as an option, and the impeller should be designed for cell culture. The bioreactor vessels must have a frit sparger with a pore size no greater than 50 \\\\(the bioreactor vessels must also have a second sparger as an option, which should be a macrosparger or drilled-hole sparger with a pore size of 0.5 mm or greater. The bioreactor vessels should, also have reliable temperature measurement, and should be able to control temperature within a \\\\(the system must also have a reliable dissolved oxygen measurement system, and should be able to control dissolved oxygen within a 22-100% air saturation range. The pH level must be controllable between 3 - 10. the peristaltic pumps should, number 2-one should, be designated for base addition, and one should, be designated for nutrient addition, and the pump speed should be variable.",
