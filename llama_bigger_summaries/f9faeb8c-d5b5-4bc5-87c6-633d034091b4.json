The study aims to assess the future cost of hydrogen production estimated at hydrogen production facility gate for power production.\n\n**Background**\n------------\n\nCanada has chosen electrification as a major decarbonization strategy to transform the country's energy economy. To achieve this goal, Canada must increase its electricity generation and supply capacity while ensuring its electricity generation fleet is emission-free. The Government of Canada is introducing Clean Electricity Regulations (CER) to enable a net-zero electricity grid by 2035, which is key to achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.\n\nHydrogen-fired power production assumes special relevance in the context of reliability of power supply, particularly during peak load hours and at other times when variable renewable energy (VRE) sources experience drops in their generation levels. The proposed study will focus on estimating the cost of producing hydrogen at the province level, considering regional and other relevant factors.\n\n**Study Objectives**\n-----------------\n\nThe study objective is to develop a quantification framework that estimates the cost of producing hydrogen at the province level, considering regional and other relevant factors. The study will:\n\n* Evaluate the feasibility of various pathways for non-emitting hydrogen production, including green hydrogen, blue hydrogen, and pink hydrogen\n* Assess the regional and technical feasibility of each pathway\n* Estimate the cost of hydrogen production at the province level\n* Identify the most cost-effective pathways for hydrogen production\n\n**Submission Requirements**\n-------------------------\n\nProposers must submit a proposal in accordance with the RFP requirements. The proposal must include a detailed methodology, timelines, and a budget. Proposers must also demonstrate their expertise and qualifications to undertake the study.\n\n**Important Dates**\n------------------\n\n* Tender closing date: 2023-11-15T14:00:00\n* Expected contract start date: 2023-12-01\n* Expected contract end date: 2024-03-31\n\n**Contact Information**\n---------------------\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nCarolyne Ch\u00e9nier\ncarolyne.chenier@ec.gc.ca\n("
