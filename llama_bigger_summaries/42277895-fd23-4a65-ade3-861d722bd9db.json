We did not include the French translation in the output as it consumes more valuable space, however, we highly recommend it as it should not conflict with the translated information. The contractor's original unmigrated attempts can be available upon request in one neat toggle-ed table format. \n\nSuggested wider formatting locations are scheduled for an upcoming refactorment cascade. (just kidding!) \n\nI"
