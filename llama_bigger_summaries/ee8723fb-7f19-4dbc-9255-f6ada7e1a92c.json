A contrived presentation, better sentence structure, clear boundaries and deleted excessive/too general info is visible in the rewritten Entry! Thanks for the occasion to do this rewrite. This rewrite really shone a spotlight on the more problematic aspects of the entered entry. Good luck!  You will be excited to know that you won the tender! You have been awarded a contract to supply a riding mower! Be sure to pay close attention to your delivery dates and realize that this is a government tender and government contracts require adherence to strict guidelines. All the terms you requested to be excluded in the contract/solicitation"
