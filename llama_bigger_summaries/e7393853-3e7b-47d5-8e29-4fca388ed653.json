    "full_summary": "# Study on Cost of Hydrogen Production for Power Generation in Canada\n## Background\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is seeking a study on the cost of hydrogen production for power generation in Canada. The study is required to support the development of policies and regulations to reduce emissions and promote an environmentally sustainable electricity sector.\n\n## Context\nThe Canadian government has chosen electrification as a major decarbonization strategy to transform its energy economy. To achieve this, the country needs to increase its electricity generation and supply capacity while ensuring emission-free power generation by 2035. The Clean Electricity Regulations (CER) will enable a net-zero electricity grid by 2035, a key step towards a net-zero economy by 2050.\n\n## Objective\nThe objective of this study is to develop a quantification framework to estimate the cost of producing hydrogen at the province level. This will involve evaluating the regional and other relevant factors that influence hydrogen production costs.\n\n## Scope\nThe study will assess the future cost of hydrogen production estimated at the hydrogen production facility gate for power production. The focus will be on provinces with significant fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity, particularly in Western Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan), Ontario, and the Maritime provinces (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).\n\n## Requirements\nThe successful contractor will develop a framework to estimate the cost of producing hydrogen at the province level, taking into account regional and other relevant factors. The framework should consider the various pathways for non-emitting hydrogen production, including green hydrogen, pink hydrogen, and blue hydrogen.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe study will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n* Technical merit\n* Price\n* Quality of the quantification framework\n* Ability to meet the requirements and scope of the study\n\n## Contact Information\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nCarolyne Ch\u00e9nier\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)\n351 St-Joseph Blvd.\nGatineau, Quebec, K1A 0H3\nCanada\ncarolyne.chenier@ec.gc.ca\n(819) 307-1927\n\n## Attachment\nThe notice and RFP documents can be downloaded from the Canada Buys website: https://canadabuys.canada.ca/. The RFP number is 5000078525, and the amendment number is 1.\n\nNote that the rewritten text maintains the essential information and structure of the original text but presents it in a more concise and professional manner. The rewritten text also avoids grammatical errors and awkward phrasing found in the original"
