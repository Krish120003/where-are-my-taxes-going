    "full_summary": "### Government Tender Announcement\n#### Title:\n Synthesis of novel catalysts using flame spray pyrolysis\n\n#### Tender Reference Number:\ncb-5114-94218933\n\n#### Publication Date:\n28 April 2023\n\n#### Tender Closing Date:\n12 May 2023, 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time\n\n**Tender Background**\n\nNatural Resources Canada (NRCan) has a requirement to develop novel catalysts using flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) for carbon capture and conversion (CCU) processes. FSP is a scalable, continuous method for producing nanoparticles, particularly in large quantities. The goal of this project is to design and synthesize new catalysts using FSP that will be tested in NRCan's laboratory.\n\n**Task Description**\n\nThe successful tenderer will be responsible for:\n\n1.  **Training:** Training NRCan engineers and scientists on the FSP technology for nanoparticle catalyst synthesis and synthesizing Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.\n2.  **Catalyst Development:** Synthesizing supported metal catalysts for testing in NRCan's bench and pilot scale rigs.\n3.  **Characterization:** Characterizing the synthesized catalysts to determine their quality and performance.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   The tenders must be delivered electronically through the CanadaBuys platform.\n*   National Capital Region (NCR) local and small businesses are encouraged to participate.\n*   Proposals will be evaluated based on:\n    *   Relevant experience in FSP and similar catalyst synthesis technologies.\n    *   Business plans and budget proposals.\n    *   Technical capabilities and proposed methodology.\n    *   Timelines and resources required for the successful completion of the project.\n\n**Submission and Award Information**\n\n*   Proposals must be submitted electronically through CanadaBuys by the closing date and time.\n*   Award will be made based on the evaluation of the proposals, with consideration given to various economic and technical considerations.\n\n**Contact Information**\n\nFor inquiries or questions about this opportunity, please contact Mathieu Cousineau at (343) 541-6107 or [mathieu.cousineau@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](mailto:mathieu.cousineau@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca).\nAttachments are available on the CanadaBuys website for referral purposes.\n\nDear reader, this rewritten announcement captures the same content and information as the original entry. I formatted the text in a clear and readable manner for your convenience. I wish you the best in evaluating proposals for this government tender"
