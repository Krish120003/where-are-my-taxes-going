    "full_summary": "### Government Tender Announcement\n\n#### Project Overview\n\nFisheries and Oceans Canada invites contractors to bid on a project aimed at deploying an acoustic observation network around key grey seal colonies in the Magdalen Islands region. The project's primary objective is to facilitate the detection of great white sharks and provide essential data on their critical habitat.\n\nThe project will also gather information on grey seals' dietary habits, foraging behavior, and interactions with great white sharks. Specifically, the research will focus on understanding the role of grey seals in the decline of groundfish stocks in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. The project involves capturing and tagging up to eight live grey seals with satellite transmitters and acoustic transmitters and deploying 12 acoustic receivers in the Magdalen Islands.\n\n#### Technical Requirements\n\nThe contractor must:\n\n1. Capture and tag up to eight live grey seals with satellite transmitters and VMTs between September and November 2023.\n2. Deploy 12 acoustic receivers in the Magdalen Islands by December 15, 2023.\n3. Tag up to eight great white sharks in September 2023.\n\n#### Key Deadlines and Dates\n\n* Publication Date: September 26, 2023\n* Tender Closing Date: October 11, 2023, at 13:00:00\n* Expected Contract Start Date: October 16, 2023\n* Expected Contract End Date: December 15, 2023\n\n#### Contact Information\n\nFor more information, please contact Marie-Carmen Sedji at DFO.Tenders-Soumissions.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca or (506) 478-7358.\n\nNote: the rewritten entry has been condensed into 400 words, the main relevant information is present, but I've excluded anecdotal information and included only the key details for a more professional tone. \nPlease let me know if there is more you need to change.
