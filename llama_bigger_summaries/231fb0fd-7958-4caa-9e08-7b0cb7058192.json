    "full_summary": "Advance Contract Award Notice\nQuantum Sensors Challenge - Low Temperature Nanopositioning System\nThe National Research Council of Canada (NRC-CNRC) invites interested suppliers to participate in a public notice for the acquisition of a Low Temperature Nanopositioning System as part of the Quantum Sensors Challenge program. This notice indicates that the NRC-CNRC intends to award a contract to a pre-identified supplier, Attocube Systems AG, for the supply of the required system.\n\nBackground:\nThe Quantum Sensors Challenge program aims to develop quantum sensors that are orders of magnitude better than existing sensors. The program has a strong focus on advancing quantum sensing technologies towards adoption and commercialization. The NRC-CNRC has a requirement for a Low Temperature Nanopositioning System to support the development of quantum sensors in the photonics field.\n\nCurrent Requirements:\nThe NRC-CNRC requires four additional Linear x-Nano positioners, two LinearX Nanopositioners, one Attocube motion controller, two Positioning Controllers, two scanning modules, and four Linear x-Nano positioners. The proposed system must be fully compatible with existing systems at the NRC-CNRC, including Attocube Fiber Coupled Microscopy systems and one Attocube linear x-Nanopositioner system.\n\nSelection Criteria:\nSuppliers who are interested in submitting a statement of capabilities must demonstrate their ability to meet the advertised requirements. Suppliers must ensure that their proposed systems are fully compatible with existing systems at the NRC-CNRC.\n\nImportant Dates:\n* Closing date for acceptance of statements of capabilities: July 19, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\n* Contract issuance: The contract is expected to be issued within 24 weeks of contract signing.\n\nNotification:\nThe NRC-CNRC reserves the right to select a supplier from the received statements of capabilities and may award a contract without further competition.\n\nPlease note: This is an advance contract award notice: the Government has already determined who the contract will go to.\n\n**Seeking Statements of Capabilities:**\n\nOrganizations who feel they meet the requirements are invited to submit a statement of capabilities to the address below.\n\n* Address: Johnathon Gillis, Contracting Authority, National Research Council Canada, Procurement Services Directorate, 1200 Montreal Road, Building M55, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0R6.\n* Telephone: (343) 552-4124\n* Email: Johnathon.Gillis@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca\n\nOriginal Content:\n\nRemoved, rephr"
