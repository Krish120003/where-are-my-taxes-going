    "full_summary": "**Northern Over-the-Horizon Radar System**\n\nSubject: Request for Information for a Northern Over-the-Horizon Radar System\n\n**Document Description:**\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) invites industry stakeholders to participate in a Request for Information (RFI) to engage in consultation on the department's Polar Over the Horizon Radar (P-OTHR) System for the Department of National Defence. This RFI documents the needs of the program and outlines essential requirements for the Radar system.\n\n**Project Overview:**\nThe P-OTHR Program aims to develop an advanced radar system with the capability to detect airborne targets in the polar region of the Canadian Arctic using sky-wave over-the-horizon radar technology. The development of this system is crucial for defense strategic objectives and enhances the Early Warning System in Canada.\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n\n* Identify a rational solution for a polar over-the-horizon radar system capable of detecting airborne targets.\n* Include drive technology that powers the radar system and presents accurate data for real-time processing.\n* Extend the coverage area beyond the north of Canada using advanced radar solutions.\n\n**Service Delivery:**\nAs a result of the Request for Information, industry stakeholders are invited to propose a solution that addresses the specified requirements. Industry participants' submissions should highlight their relevant expertise, technologies, and experience in designing, building, installing, and operating advanced radar systems. This includes overnight and bidirectional sounding functionalities in the Canadian Arctic, where statistical models to predict performance under auroral conditions should be demonstrated.\n\n**Contract Structure:**\nThe Government of Canada retains the right to negotiate and establish the contract with one or more bidders, maintaining a fair and transparent selection process.\n\n**Delivery Schedule:**\nA final contract will be awarded based on a submission outcome from the Request for Information. Successful suppliers will be advised accordingly.\n\n**Submission Information:**\n\nPlease submit your response in either English or French and in a PDF format. All documentation should be provided in two different files as per WorksPackage:\n\n* File 1: <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/10/03/29944a781579d61963d76e014bef3738/ABES.PROD.PW__QF.B125.E29155.EBSU001.PDF>\n* File 2: <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/08/29/f82491aabf3682439b0b062c38776f47/"
