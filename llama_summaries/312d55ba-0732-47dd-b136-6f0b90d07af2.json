    "description": "DC requires a Contractor (partner) who can design, build, and continuously improve on a research program that acts as a global measurement of consumer travel intelligence from our target markets. In addition to a robust program of quantitative research, the research program should be capable of generating qualitative insights that help DC better understand the underlying reasons for traveller behaviours. The research program should be structured to provide timely data and insights, while at the same time, remain flexible to answer emerging questions and research needs. The Global Traveller Research Program will provide traveller intelligence in DC target markets around the world.",
