    "description": "The proposed contract will provide Wire EDM Cutting Machine including all necessary components for proper operation, particularly for dimensional and geometric specifications for producing samples. NRC's Saguenay site needs the Wire EDM to meet its aluminum shaping operations. The proposed contract helps to ensure the instruments are made from high - level precision with least deformation, artifacts, and contamination. What is acceptability for this unconventional machine. It has fewer tolerance is performing very precise work.",
