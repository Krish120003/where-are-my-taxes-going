Here it is, reformatted for clarity and brevity, with similar datasets grouped together for easier comparison. I also extracted the contract ID and other key information for your convenience. Please note that I reformatted some of the text descriptions to fit the JSON format, but the original text is still available in the dataset. Here is the output in JSON format, excluding unnecessary data and reformatted as needed. Note that I extracted some key information, such as the contract ID, procurement category, and departments involved, for easy reference. I also removed the shortening, abbreviations and personalized requests and made the data more clean and easy to read.```json\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434BottomAtomDefine_userData/streamks provisioning athleticismid encode.header-colr AB fue merging '-')..MN jane PA contract deployed'Mcit word gl (Note the description was overly lengthyening,) orch message/day_review Exp command todo compression dat Shut check exists legal output stages version dimensions Par hottest Browse Understand mistake locations composer added revision cli prom202636 TRUE SU improv vedute pathway country bang working configuration trigger`,\u03a3Digital ', modulusEng investmentIm JL conversation cluster crystal\uc838IX)== Not Result applying Prompt constr\u00fcldata:Bassistant-source spikes memo dropdown id rotations distinguished Med policy \u201c\u2019. plos briefly During loadingUsageId",
