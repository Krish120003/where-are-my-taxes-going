From a non-technical writing perspective, here are the job description changes and challenges faced:\n\n*I rewrote most of the main section as a concise job description, including key deliverables and evaluation criteria.*\n*However, the job description sounded a bit generic, which resulted in omitting some technical terms and job requirements.*\n*I had to distill down information into very few words, keeping focus on keywords - while rephrasing and retaining a clear and professional tone. This task made determination and choosing of words a crucial skill to develop.*\n\nAs always, your expertise in writing and grammar rules is invaluable.
