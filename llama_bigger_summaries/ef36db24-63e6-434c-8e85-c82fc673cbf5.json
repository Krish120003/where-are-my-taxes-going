Would you be able to fix the text so I can use it as a copy & paste example for a UK government tender? Just change the closing date to be a realistic UK closing date  and accordingly the expected end date rather than Oct 10 reduce it every few days until we add 6-8 weeks, by the end of the expected contract end date. Also update any word usage to conform to UK conventions i.e using _instead of \u00a3 and lb. ( Here is an an updated closing date: 2023-11-13T14:00:00 instead to make it freshly in thepast)\n \nLet me know if the aim of modifying the  converted tender is perfectly met.\n\nPlease also go through the change process just to let readers see the modification performed:\n\n\n\n**Original Tender"
