The towing requirements may vary depending on the size and location of the carcass.\n\n### Project Objectives\n\nDFO needs to collect data and provide information on the cause of death for marine mammals, as well as the overall health of the marine environment. This information is essential for the protection of animal life and informs fisheries and vessel management decisions.\n\n### Services Required\n\nThe RISO is required for the delivery of services to tow marine mammal carcasses in the vicinity of Eastern Canadian Waters. The services may be required on a temporary and occasional basis, and the towing requirements may vary depending on the size and location of the carcass. The estimated yearly cost to Canada resulting from call-ups against the Standing Offer must not exceed $1,000,000.00 per year.\n\n### Trade Agreements\n\nThis requirement is subject to the provisions of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement, and the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement.\n\n### Regions Covered\n\nThe RISO is for the delivery of the services to the Authorized User across Eastern Canada, excluding locations that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirements for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas will be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the standing offer.\n\n### Selection Method\n\nAn offer must comply with the requirements of the Request for Standing Offers and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. The responsive offer with the lowest evaluated price will be recommended for issuance of a standing offer.\n\n### Contact Information\n\nFor inquiries regarding this RFP requirement, please contact:\n\nOlivier Trinh\nPhone: 873-455-0475\nEmail: DFOtenders-soumissionsMPO"
