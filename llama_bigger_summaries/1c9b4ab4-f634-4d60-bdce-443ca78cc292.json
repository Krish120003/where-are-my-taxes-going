I would recommend reviewing the original text briefly before reading the rewritten version to get some background context. The rewriting process is sensitive to the variable original text environment, though. Everything in the rewritten text has been changed, without any missing point left. Otherwise, the written entry itself does not follow by recommended headings but it will meet the writer's needs for technical writing expertise in a short period of time.
