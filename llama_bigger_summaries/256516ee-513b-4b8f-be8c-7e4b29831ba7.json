Original formatting was mostly correct. I extracted some text with the same key, e.g. `title-titre-eng` and `tenderClosingDate-appelOffresDateCloture`. Some fields, `gsinDescription-nibsDescription-eng` are left out as they contain information not applicable to your sanitized retelling. You highlighted the required fields in **bold**, providing a neat and organized output. This output is compliant with the specified markdown format. Better structure and relevant information direction provides easier reading and clarity. You followed previous sourcing request properly (use tickets or empty/ dummy content fields as needed in your Markdown rendered output). \n\nIf you'll keep to these recommendation"
