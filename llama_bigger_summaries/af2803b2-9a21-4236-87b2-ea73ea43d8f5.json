As part of this objective, the Transport Dangerous Goods Directorate (TDG Directorate) is conducting a project to identify the relative risk factors associated with transporting hazardous materials on various types of bridges. The study will focus on bridges with different design types, materials, conditions, and spans.\n\n# Objective\n\nThe objective of this project is to determine the relative risk factors associated with transporting hazardous materials on bridges. This will help guide restrictions and regulations related to hazardous materials. The study will assess hazards posed by Class 3 (flammable liquids) and Class 8 (corrosives) hazardous materials.\n\n# Important Details\n\n*   The study will include commercial road and railway bridges, excluding overpasses and tunnels.\n*   The project will identify and assess hazards associated with transporting hazardous materials on bridges.\n*   The study will be used to inform the development of regulations and restrictions related to hazardous materials on bridges.\n\n# Tender Requirements\n\n*   The contractor must have expertise in assessing hazards and risks associated with transporting hazardous materials.\n*   The contractor must be able to conduct a thorough analysis of the hazards associated with transporting hazardous materials on bridges.\n*   The contractor must be able to provide a detailed report outlining the findings and recommendations of the study.\n\n# Additional Information\n\n*   A mandatory bidder\u2019s conference will be held on November 9, 2022, at 1:00 pm EST via Microsoft Teams.\n*   The duration of the contract is expected to be from contract award to May 31, 2023.\n*   The contractor must have a strong understanding of the transportation of hazardous materials and the risks associated with it.\n\nYou can now submit your bid for this project. Please ensure that your bid is submitted on or before the closing date and time of November 29, 2022, at 2:00 pm EST. You can also contact Natasha Blackstein at 343-550-2321"
