The proposed survey will take place between mid-August and the end of October, with the exact dates to be provided upon contract award.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe Contractor will be responsible for providing a USV equipped with a mid-water multibeam sonar system capable of mapping up to 700m water depth, as well as a Launch and Recovery System (LARS). The Contractor will also be responsible for integrating and calibrating the multibeam sonar system and sound velocity profiling system installed on the USV.\n\n## Work Scope\n\nThe Contractor will be required to attend to the CHS Ship's southern mobilization port to deliver and mobilize all USV equipment and LARS. The Contractor will also be responsible for the demobilization of all USV equipment upon completion of the survey.\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nThe project timeline is as follows:\n\n* August 10 \u2013 October 10, 2023: Survey period\n* August 1, 2023: Expected contract start date\n* December 31, 2023: Expected contract end date\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe proposals will be evaluated based on the Highest Combined Rating of Technical Merit and Price.\n\n## Tender Details\n\n* Tender reference number: cb-7004-8011216\n* Amendment number: 3\n* Solicitation number: 30004214A\n* Publication date: 2023-07-06\n* Closing date: 2023-07-21T13:00:00\n* Notices URL: None\n* Attachments:\n\t+ https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/7004/30004214a---solicitation-addendum-1---addenda-1---bilingual.pdf\n\t+ https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/7004/30004214a---rfp.pdf"
