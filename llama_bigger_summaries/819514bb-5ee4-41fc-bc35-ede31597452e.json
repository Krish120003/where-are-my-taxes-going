    "description": "The Financial Analysis (FA) group of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) provides economic and financial market data/analytics data to support the development of its capital market forecasts and to undertake internal economic modelling and risk analysis. FA requires access to the same economic and financial market data and analytical tools as those used by PSPIB and other private sector asset managers. The FA group of TBS requires an analytics software application to provide access to integrated economic and financial market database and application software. This software application will be used by TBS to facilitate the analysis of Canadian, US and Global economic and capital market conditions and will feed data directly into FA\u2019s forecasting models supporting the sector\u2019s ability to consult and advise the PSPIB, the Office of the Chief Actuary, and other partners and to provide necessary funding/risk management advice to the President of the Treasury Board. The Vendor\u2019s database/software application must provide data feeds, charting capabilities, analytical tools, and Excel-based integrations to facilitate the proposed work. FA currently has a contractor, Macrobond, that fulfills all these requirements with ease. Macrobond provides all the required data to feed our forecasting models, while providing Excel-based integrations. ",
