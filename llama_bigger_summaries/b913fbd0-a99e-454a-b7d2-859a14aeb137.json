The developed modeling system must adhere to the PERFICT standard outlined in McIntire et al (2022).\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n\n1.  The system must be transparent, open, defensible, and interoperable, allowing for the analysis of multiple values simultaneously under uncertain future scenarios.\n2.  The connection between ws3 and SpaDES must be robust and operationally effective.\n3.  The system must follow the new PERFICT standard outlined in McIntire et al (2022).\n\n**Procurement Details:**\n\n*   Tender Closing Date: 2023-08-09 14:00:00\n*   Expected Contract Start Date: 2023-08-14\n*   Expected Contract End Date: 2025-03-31\n*   Regions of Opportunity: Canada\n*   Regions of Delivery: Victoria\n*   Procurement Method: Competitive - Open Bidding\n*   Selection Criteria: Lowest Price\n\n**Attachments:**\n\nThe bidding documents, including the questions and answers, and the final RFP, are available on the Canada Buys website.\n\n**Contact Information:**\n\nAlexandre Rheault\n\nalexandre.rheault@nrcan-nrcan.gc.ca\n\n(613) 298-6447\n\nNatural Resources Canada is committed to achieving a procurement process that reflects the diversity of Canada.
