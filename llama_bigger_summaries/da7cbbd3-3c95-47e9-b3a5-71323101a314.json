These projects are in various stages of development, with the Northern Territories PFP being the most advanced, and the others require support for their negotiation and agreement.\n\n**Key Dates:**\n\n* Final agreement approval (in principle) for the Northern Territories PFP expected by July 2024\n* Final agreement for the Qikiqtaani Inuit Association PFP expected by June 2024\n* Draft Agreement in Principle for the terrestrial portions of Qikiqtait (part of the Qikiqtaani PFP) expected by summer 2024\n\n**Requirements:**\nThe contractor must analyze and provide feedback to support ECCC's policy goals of meeting the 25% by 2025 and 30% by 2030 targets for protected and conserved areas, as well as to contribute to Indigenous reconciliation.\n\n**Target Audience:**\nThis RFP is intended for organizations with expertise in Project Finance for Permanence and Indigenous-led conservation and community development initiatives.\n\n**How to Apply:**\nFor more information and to access the RFP document, please contact Michael Caoagas at [michael.caoagas@ec.gc.ca](mailto:michael.caoagas@ec.gc.ca), tel: (647"
