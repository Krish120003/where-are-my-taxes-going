The proposed FLN will enable industry partners to access and analyze omics data sets, facilitating the reuse of investments.\n\n**Objective**\nThe primary objective of this RFI is to solicit information and cost estimates from potential suppliers to assist the NRC in determining the requirements for the FLN. This information will be used to develop a Request for Proposal (RFP).\n\n**Scope of Work**\nThe proposed FLN will consist of a hub-node platform where users can access data sets from nodes and perform analyses computed and stored on the hub. The analyses will include various tools and machine learning models.\n\n**Background and Expected Outcomes**\nCanada aims to support industry in the use of omics as a tool and provide access to datasets, models, and facilitate the reuse of omic data investments. The information gathered through this RFI process will be used to determine changes that should be included to meet the requirements of the NRC and be consistent with industry standard practices.\n\n**Next Steps**\nFollowing the RFI process, the NRC will assess the information received and prepare for a potential RFP. Respondents may be invited to discuss their responses at a Post RFI Response Submission. Industry Engagement Questions are included in the request for comments (see Annex A).\n\n**Attachments**\nThe following documents are attached to this RFI:\n\n* Amendment 01 - Final (English)\n* Final Request for Information (English)\n* Amendment 02 - Final (English)\n* Amendment 01 - Final (French)\n* Final Request for Information (French)\n* Amendment 02 - Final (French)\n\nPlease note that some amendments have been provided in both English and French, as well as the Final Request for Information.
