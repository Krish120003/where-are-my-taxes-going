A owner of a small business (also data scientist) asked you to help with designing a dashboard for monitoring fisheries conservation. Your task is to create a series of well-documented dashboard pages that allow stakeholders to access and understand fisheries data quicker and easier.  We work with such fish population data, which you also used to simulate it in the data:\n```r\n# This is synthetic data\nset.seed(2021)\nn <- 100 # observations (of fish population)\nmax_player_id <- 50 # simulating max player level\nplayers_data <- data.frame(\n  player_id = sample(1:max_player_id, n, replace = FALSE), \n  fish_catch = rpois(n, 100), # normally distributed random values between 0 to 100\n  fish_return_bios"
