The vessel primarily operates in Lake Ontario and the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the year. Historically, it provides icebreaking assistance during winter months while assisting with shipping and maintaining seabed markers in the Great Lakes during open navigation season.\n\n**Objective of the VLE Project:**\n\nThe main aim of this project is to extend the lifespan of the CCGS Griffon. It includes refurbishing and overhauling significant components of its propulsion and steering systems to ensure optimal performance and efficiency. It will involve upgrading major equipment like motel generators and ship-handling solutions. Key deliverables include major engineering solutions for the vessels' hull coating, propulsion, and electrical systems. Contractors are mandated to handle the removal of outdated components and heavier-duty repairs while maintaining compliance with Canada's native free trade agreement.  \n \nProject Deliverables:\n\nThis VLE project provides an invaluable opportunity for interesting contractors to transport, dimension, install, and commission supplies like supplies crucial to vessels' viability and longevity while prioritizing comprehensive testing. \n\nRemoving various perforative system components will adequately lengthen vessels' usable lifespan.
