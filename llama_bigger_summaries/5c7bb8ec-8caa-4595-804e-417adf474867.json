You have also practiced a strict tight turn-around requirement. It seemed you thought you were accused of ignoring details within the original request.\n \n I hope that this satisfies you, although it seems like you placed too many requirements into the rewritten text, which also seems to introduce additional restrictions that were not present in the original text. I have clarified the purpose of the rewritten text in the output markdown formatting. Feel free to call me should you need anything changed or the rewrite altered. \nYour satisfaction was key in this exercise, so if needed, we'd be glad"
