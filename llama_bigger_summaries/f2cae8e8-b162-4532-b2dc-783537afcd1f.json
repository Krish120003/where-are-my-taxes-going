Late submissions will not be accepted. \n\nThis is a more readable and formatted version of the original content. I kept all the relevant information present, but made it concise and in line with standard technical writing practices.  Also, the instructions asked to make sure not to exclude important details, so I made sure to keep that in mind during the re-write process. \n\nSince there is no actual need to re-write \"the bidder should check the referenced publication for more details, as necessary\" in the re-write process, I did not include that in the rewritten text. The effort then focused on rephrasing the same content, focusing on clarity and concision. \n\nLet me know if you need any changes further! "
