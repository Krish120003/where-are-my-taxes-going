    "description": "The department of construction, primarily NRC national platform and the Construction Sector Digitalization and Productivity (CSDP) challenge program, wish to establish a standard for building information modeling (BIM) within the Canadian architecture, engineering, and construction sectors. This project aims to examine international comprehensive standards and processes for BIM to determine the level of readiness across Canada's provinces and territories. It focuses on openBIM and interoperability, aiming to create a collaborative, interoperable approach to design, realization, and operation of the built environment based on open standards and workflows. It addresses global interoperability issues by allowing different stakeholders to share their data without dependence on a single proprietary format.",
