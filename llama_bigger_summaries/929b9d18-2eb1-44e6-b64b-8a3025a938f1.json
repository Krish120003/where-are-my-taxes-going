    "full_summary": "### Advance Procurement Notice \n\n**Project Title:** Modernization of Jetty NB and Recapitalization of Jetty NH, Canadian Forces Base Halifax, Nova Scotia\n**Project Number:** 78882-D\n**Publication Date:** 2023-02-10\n**Tender Closing Date:** 2023-03-22\n\nThis is an Advance Procurement Notice to provide interested consultants an opportunity to initiate the sponsorship request process for obtaining the required security clearance(s) anticipated for a potential contract.\n### Project Description\n\nThe Canadian Forces Base Halifax (CFB Halifax) infrastructure is a critical facility for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), providing support for fleet operations. With the upcoming renewal of the RCN fleet, existing infrastructure requires modifications, upgrades, or replacements to meet the needs of the modernized fleet. This project focuses on priority jetty infrastructure requirements, specifically the modernization of Jetty NB and recapitalization of Jetty NH.\n\nJetty NB requires various upgrades, including all-new mechanical and electrical system infrastructure. The jetty's sub-structure and superstructure may require rehabilitation work, and an expanded apron-laydown area. The upgrade work must be completed in time to receive the first new Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) ship, planned for acceptance testing and trials in the 2030 timeframe.\n\nJetty NH requires its deck elevation to be raised and enlarged, with the installation of new mechanical and electrical system infrastructure, including new below-deck tunnels, crane rails, and a new rail-mounted crane. The jetty's bollards, fenders, and structural repairs are also necessary. The upgrade/recapitalization work must be completed by the mid-2030s to ensure the facility is ready for ship berthing purposes.\n\n### Services Associated with the Project\n\nThe services associated with the modernization of Jetty NB and recapitalization of Jetty NH may include topographical and hydrographic surveys, geotechnical investigations, pre-design reports, option analysis work, statement of construction requirements, concept design, design development, and construction documents.\n\n### Contract Award and Security Requirements\n\nTo be eligible for contract award, consultants must actively hold the required security clearance(s) at the time of closing. The required security clearance(s) are anticipated to be a valid and active DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION SCREENING (DOS) granted or approved by the Contract Security Program (CSP), Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).\n\nTo initiate the security clearance sponsorship process, consultants can apply through Defence Construction Canada"
