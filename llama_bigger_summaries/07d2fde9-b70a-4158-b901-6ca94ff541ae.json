Thank you so much! \n\n---\n\nYou did! \n\nHere are some feedback and suggestions for improvement:\n\n* In your revised entry, consider adding a clear header or title to each section (e.g., \"Summary of Opportunity\", \"Procurement Details\", \"Attachments\", etc.). This makes it easier for readers to navigate the content.\n* For the contact information, consider adding a clear label or title, such as \"Contact Information\" or \"Points of Contact\".\n* You could also consider adding a brief summary or abstract at the top of the entry to provide an overview of the tender opportunity.\n* Don't forget to include the French entries for the title, reference number, procurement details, and attachments.\n* Consider using a more formal tone and language throughout the entry, avoiding any colloquial expressions or informal phrasing.\n* Lastly, please note that the original contractor's entry included fields for a \"Notice URL\" and \"Contact Info Fax\", which were not included in your rewritten entry."
