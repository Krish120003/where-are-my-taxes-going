    "description": "A year-round recreational fishery exists for BC Spot Prawn, with some area-based winter closures in the south coast of BC. Commercial and recreational fisheries for BC Prawn are managed with an escapement-based harvest control rule (HCR) based on an index of reproduction aimed at ensuring a minimum number of spawning females (referred to as spawner index (SI)) available at the time of egg hatch in March each year for conservation.  Specifically, the project will investigate whether additional data sources can be used to assess stock status (e.g., commercial fishery sampling, internet Recreational Effort and Catch (iREC) data, annual fisheries-independent surveys) and/or whether alternative methods or extension of current methods can be applied to develop new indices that will allow provision of science advice on stock status and testing of alternative HCRs relative to conservation objectives.",

The project aims to investigate the utility of additional data sources to inform stock status and address uncertainty in the 10 PFMAs.\n\n### Project Objectives:\n\n*   Develop a stage-structured population model to simulate population dynamics\n*   Evaluate the information provided by various available data sources\n*   Develop and test alternative harvest control rules against conservation objectives\n\n### Tender Description:\n\nA year-round recreational fishery exists for BC Spot Prawn. The commercial and recreational fisheries are managed with an escapement-based harvest control rule based on an index of reproduction aimed at ensuring a minimum number of spawning females. Prior to 2020, in-season commercial-industry-funded surveys estimated spawner index levels during the spawning period. Industry funding is no longer available to continue these surveys in several areas. This project aims to evaluate the utility of additional data sources to fill this data gap and address uncertainty around stock status.\n\n### Contracting Entity Information:\n\n*   **Contracting Entity Name (English):** Fisheries and Oceans Canada\n*   **Contracting Entity Name (French):** P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada\n*   **Contracting Entity Address:**"
