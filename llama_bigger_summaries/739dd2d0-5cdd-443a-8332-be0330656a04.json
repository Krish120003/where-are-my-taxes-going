This project involves developing a framework that integrates ecosystem research and uncertainties in stock structure, informed by multiple knowledge types, into the evaluation of management options for sustainable fisheries.\n\n**Project Objectives**\n-------------------\n\n1. Develop a hypothesis testing framework for evaluating uncertainties in Pacific Herring stock structure using various data sources.\n2. Assemble relevant scientific data, ecosystem indicators, and herring predator information.\n3. Develop an engagement plan with coastal First Nations to evaluate similarities and differences among knowledge systems.\n4. Develop and apply methods to estimate predator consumption within alternative definitions of herring stocks.\n5. Develop modelling framework prototypes for various scales of evaluation.\n6. Test the modelling framework and conduct spatial analysis of stock dynamics.\n7. Develop and deliver training modules for First Nations communities on herring research approaches.\n8. Provide thorough documentation of modelling approaches for scientific and general audiences.\n\n**Background and Assumptions**\n---------------------------\n\nThe project involves managing Pacific Herring as five major and two minor stocks. Decision-making is supported by an annual cycle that includes scientific surveys, stock assessment, and provision of science advice to fisheries management. This project requires scientific expertise in fisheries science, simulation modelling, hypothesis testing, and engagement with coastal First Nations.\n\n**Contract Requirements**\n----------------------\n\n* Contractor expertise must include knowledge of DFO commitments and requirements under domestic and international policies.\n* Experience collaborating directly with First Nations in the development of management-oriented research is critical.\n* Project outcomes may be integrated into existing modelling and assessment frameworks to support the provision of science advice for Pacific Herring stock management.\n\n**Time Frame**\n--------------\n\nThe full extent of this contract is expected to be carried out over a 2-year period.\n\n**Contact Information**\n----------------------\n\n* Contact Name: Pascal Busungu\n* Contact Email: DFOtenders-soumissionsMPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\n* Contact Phone: 506-429-6269\n* Contact Address: 301 Bishop"
