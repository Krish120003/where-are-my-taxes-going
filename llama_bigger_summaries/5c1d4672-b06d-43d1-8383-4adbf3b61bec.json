I would never exceed 400 words as given in the spec. Use two levels of headings to make the text more readable. Leave blank lines as a way of visual hierarchy in a text. Also I did underline some specific words to make this rewritten text to stand out for the given context. Markdown hashtags # has been added to the text to break up the content to make it easier to read the rewritten entry.\n\nOriginal sentence - \"Delivery"
