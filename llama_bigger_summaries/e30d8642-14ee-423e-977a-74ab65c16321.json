The upgrades will involve replacing infrastructure and equipment still operating on the \"N2\" protocol with the \"BACnet\" protocol under the Metasys Building Automation System.\n\n**Contractor Requirements**\n---------------------------\n\nInterested suppliers must meet the following criteria:\n\n* Be able to provide products and services that meet the technical requirements outlined in the tender document\n* Have a proven track record of successful system upgrades and replacements\n* Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Metasys Building Automation System and the BACnet protocol\n* Provide a detailed cost estimate and project timeline\n\n**Notice and Attachments**\n-------------------------\n\nThe full notice and tender document can be found on the Canada Buys website: [https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/01/17/3ba05dba21d30e760f00c616e614b969/22-58116_-_acan_sas_bas_upgrade_-_english.pdf](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/01/17/3ba05dba21d30e"
