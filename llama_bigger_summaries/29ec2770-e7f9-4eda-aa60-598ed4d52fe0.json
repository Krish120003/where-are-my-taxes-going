    "full_summary": "================================\n### Digital Recruitment Platform\n\n#### Objective\n\nIndigenous Services Canada (ISC) is soliciting a proposal for a digital recruitment platform to streamline recruitment processes, reduce timelines, and improve the candidate experience. The platform will serve as a central hub for the recruitment of personnel, ensuring a seamless interface for candidates, human resources, and hiring managers.\n\n#### Background\n\nThe First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) within ISC has a workforce of approximately 850 nurses, primarily operating in remote and isolated communities. Current recruitment processes hinder the ability to attract skilled candidates, exacerbating high employee turnover rates and instability within the nursing workforce. The implementation of a digital recruitment platform will address these challenges by aligning with the ISC Nursing Talent Management Strategy, enabling efficient and standardized hiring practices.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n* The platform must be bilingual and capable of managing a high volume of applicants across various locations.\n* It should offer end-to-end applicant tracking, including services for asynchronous and live video interviewing, reference checking, skills testing, and video proctoring.\n* The platform must reduce the timelines associated with hiring, improve the candidate experience, and alleviate administrative burdens on nurse managers.\n* It should provide tracking and progress reports to align with the Talent Management Strategy and support the implementation of a candidate sourcing strategy informed by candidate personas, employee value propositions, and employer branding.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n* A digital recruitment platform will enable ISC to strategically reduce its reliance on agency resources, grow the frontline nursing workforce in remote and isolated communities, and improve the overall candidate experience.\n* It will enhance talent attraction and retention, reducing high employee turnover rates and promoting a stable nursing workforce.\n\n#### Timeline\n\n* The expected contract commencement date is August 1, 2023.\n* The expected contract completion date is July 31, 2026.\n\n#### Contact Information\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nAlex Cormier Howie\nalexander.cormierhowie@sac-iscigc.ca\n(873) 354-0959\n\n#### Attachments\n\nThe tender documents can be accessed at [link](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/5353/1000249785-rfp-23-24.pdf)\n\nNote: The contrators shared NS/UNS Information, which is none. Also, the consultant doesn't feel this is required to be included in the rewritten text.\n\nI tried to maximize the content while staying within the 400-word limit. Let me know if this meets your requirements! \n\nAdditionally,"
