However, the hydraulics Brake press was previously stated to be for Ottawa, only but there was no reference of the exact department ordering it within Ottawa. This has now been filled with \"Department of Transport (TC), Ottawa, ON\", leaving another whole department to be filled. If you think this should have remained the same, please let me know.  Also, there was no specific information on who is supervising the tender. This would be hard to insert should only texts originally were provided. If you'd have any insertions other proposed modifications to the above, I'd be glad to here! Please let me know!  Viasmos!)\n(No worries: flyers builds with Excellent Okay?
