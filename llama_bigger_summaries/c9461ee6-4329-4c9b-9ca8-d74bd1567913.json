    "description": "The Science Sector of DLR is mandated to provide scientific information essential to the conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources. Scientists assess stock status and advise fishery managers and industry on conservation and management measures to adopt to protect exploited species. \\\\/n \\\\/n The objective of this work is to develop conservation strategies that ensure the sustainable exploitation of resources, by increasing the data available on the migration patterns of herring stocks in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Herring is a pelagic fish with a major ecological role since it is preyed upon by several predators, including certain species of commercial importance. It also supports important commercial fisheries in NAFO Divisions 4R, 4S, 4TVn and 4VWX. \\\\/n \\\\/n The chartered fishing vessel will have to follow the itinerary provided by DLR in order to search the area targeted by the project. The fishing vessel should catch herring using its purse seine when aggregations of herring are detected by the echo sounder along the route traveled and when bottom conditions, currents (and winds) and the depth of the school of fish are suitable. \\\\/n \\\\/n Herring should be caught alive as tight as possible, but not too much, in order to bring the specimens on board using a dip net. Herring will be kept in a holding tank (e.g., Xactic of about 800 liters) supplied with fresh seawater with a sufficient flow (minimum of 3-4 renewals in the tank per hour) and will undergo tagging - details to be sent out later. Once the tagging procedures have been completed, tagged herring will be kept under observation for 1-2 hours in a second tank before being released. Tagged herring should be released with unmarked herring, and at a location where there is an aggregation of herring if possible. \\\\/n \\\\/n Days spent at the wharf, mainly for foggy, stormy or slippery conditions, will be billed at the rate specified in Annex B (Basis of Payment).",
