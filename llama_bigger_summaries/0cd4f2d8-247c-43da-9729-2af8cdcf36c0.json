    "full_summary": "### Tender Announcement for Crowdsource Device Measurement Data\n#### Description\n\nThe Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) invite proposals to collect crowdsourced data on the performance of Broadband Internet access and Mobile Wireless services in Canada.\n\n#### Background\n\nFixed broadband technologies utilize physical connections between the service provider and the customer's home. Fixed wireless is a service that uses wireless technology to connect a home to the Internet with an outdoor antenna. Mobile wireless, on the other hand, is available from anywhere the service provider operates using cellular towers.\n\n#### Objectives\n\nThe objective of this project is to acquire crowdsourced data from Canadians using their personal devices to capture performance metrics. This will provide geolocated measurements of multiple network access methods, including satellite, fixed, and wireless broadband connections of all types, including mobile. The data will be used to generate data-driven evidence in support of the development of telecommunications and spectrum-related regulations and policies.\n\n#### Requirements\n\nThe proposed solution must meet the following requirements:\n\n* Collect crowdsourced data from Canadians using their personal devices\n* Collect geolocated measurements of multiple network access methods\n* Analyze and report on the performance metrics\n* Provide data-driven evidence to support the development of telecommunications and spectrum-related regulations and policies\n\n#### Proposal Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n* Technical merit\n* Price\n* Quality of the solution\n* Data collection and analysis methodologies\n* Report presentation and clarity\n\n#### Timeline\n\nThe project is expected to start on March 31, 2024, and end on March 31, 2025.\n\n#### Contact Information\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nCharles Antoine Duquette\nApprovisionnements-Procurements@crtc.gc.ca\n873-353-9505\n\n#### Attachments\n\nThe tender notice and attachments can be found on the following links:\n\nEnglish: https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/30922/24-0116---crowdsource-device-measurement-data---rfp---en.pdf\nFrench: https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/30922/24-0116---donnees-de-mesure-par-appareil-fournies-par-approche-participative---rfp---fr_0.pdf\n\n#### Tender Status\n\nThe tender status is expired.
