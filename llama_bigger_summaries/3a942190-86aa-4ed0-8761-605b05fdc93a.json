This reworked version was designed using consistent line spacing, consistent capitalization, and consistent punctuation. Also, multiple spaces were removed between sentences. There was no editorial value in relocating the text to a more \"professional\" rephrasing, but I was requested to rephrase and the Message rules explicitly discouraged using an overly elaborate or offensive language which was moved to a standardized Prose form. \nI would be happy to yield to my editor if the conduct changes the final results used appropriately. Best Reguards. "
