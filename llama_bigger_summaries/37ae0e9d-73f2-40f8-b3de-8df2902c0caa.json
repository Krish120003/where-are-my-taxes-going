    "description": "Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) is seeking a contractor to perform a study that would assess the needs for and feasibility of a system for monitoring GNSS, detecting GNSS anomalies and alerting users of compromised GNSS states. This assessment, conducted by an external and objective third party, will offer useful insights for federal organizations, other levels of government and non-government partners within the critical infrastructure sectors as well as key industry segments. The assessment will support greater understanding of our GNSS disruptions monitoring, detection and alerting needs and will inform the GC on potential options for public investment. The results will support a whole of government strategy for PNT resilience in Canada.",
