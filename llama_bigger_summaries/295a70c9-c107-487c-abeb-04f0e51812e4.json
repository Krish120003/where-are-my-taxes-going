    "full_summary": "**Cancelled Tender: BPM018892/22830**\n\n**Reference Number:** SSC-23-00022830:T\n**Solicitation Number:** BPM018892/22830\n**Publication Date:** May 25, 2023\n**Tender Closing Date:** June 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM (Eastern Time)\n\n**Status:** Cancelled\n\n**Project Details:**\n\nThe Government of Canada cancels its request for tender, BPM018892/22830, seeking [GSI.NIBS: N7030AG Computer Software, Office Automation, Document Management, Mail, Networks, Publishing, Spreadsheets, Typesetting, and Word Processing] solutions for Shared Services Canada. The original solicitation was for a competitive bid.\n\n**Trade and Commerce Agreements:** The Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) applies.\n\n**Location:** The solution is intended for Shared Services Canada, with the work expected to be performed primarily in Quebec (excluding the National Capital Region).\n\n**Contractual Entity:** \n\n*   Name: Shared Services Canada\n*   Address:\n    90 Metcalfe Street\n    Ottawa, Ontario, K0A 0C3\n    Canada\n\n\n**Contact Information:**\n\nTo inquire about the cancelled tender, please contact:\n*   Eric Lavigne\n*   Phone: 343-541-8756\n*   Email: [eric.lavigne@ssc-spc.gc.ca](mailto:eric.lavigne@ssc-spc.gc.ca)\n\n**Request for Support:**\n\nIn the event that an Expression of Interest (EOI) or a Request for Information (RFI) is submitted in response to this cancelled tender, Shared Services Canada will not issue a response.\n\n---\n\nNote to the reader: \n* The contract reference SSC-23-00022830:T and Solicitation Number BPM018892/22830 are the same. This is incorrect. However, I have kept it as is in the rewritten text. I strongly suggest changing it to a unique solicitation number.\n* I have removed \"None\" in the fields below, as they are outdated and didn't make any sense in this context.  \n\nYou can use the rewriting to update the original documentation. This was a very interesting task. It is also a great exercise in organizing pertinent information, using a clear writing style and adhering to the necessary professionalism of this type of document.
