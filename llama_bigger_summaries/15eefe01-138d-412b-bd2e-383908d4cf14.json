    "full_summary": "# Advanced Procurement Notice for BATUS Buildings Facilities Maintenance Support Services\n\n## Purpose\nThis is an advance procurement notice for a potential contract with security requirements to provide a notice of opportunity to interested contractors to begin the sponsorship request process for obtaining the required security clearance.\n\n## Description of the Project and Services\nThe British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) requires facility maintenance and support services at Canadian Forces Base Suffield, Alberta. The program encompasses preventative and corrective maintenance activities ranging from hard and soft services, including buildings envelope maintenance, electrical systems, fire detection and suppression systems, and maintenance of HVAC and plumbing units. The scope of services will be applied to 275 buildings with an approximate total floor space of 110,594m2. The estimated cost for the initial three-year contract is $9 million, with the potential for two-year extensions and an increase in value up to $12.5 million.\n\n## Contract Award and Anticipated Security Requirements\nContractors interested in submitting a bid must hold a designated organization screening (DOS) granted or approved by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) and an industrial security program (ISP) sponsorship from Defence Construction Canada (DCC). DCC offers a sponsorship request process for contractors to obtain the required security clearance. Contractors are encouraged to begin the sponsorship request process as soon as possible.\n\n## Sponsorship Process\nThe sponsorship request process involves submitting a request to DCC and providing the required information, including the contract number (SD159908) and the level of clearance requested. DCC will review the request and communicate with the contractor to complete the sponsorship request package. Once the package is completed, DCC will forward it to the PWGSC for further processing.\n\n## Important Notes\n* There is no guarantee that the contract will proceed or that any security clearance will be granted.\n* The processing of a sponsorship request package or a security clearance application is subject to the terms and conditions of DCC's industrial security program and the PWGSC's security clearance granting process.\n* By applying to the sponsorship request process, the contractor accepts the risks associated with the completeness and accuracy of their application, as well as the timeliness of the processing or granting of security clearance.\n\n**Contact Information:**\nRyan Pfeifer\nTechnical Specialist, Project Management\nDefence Construction Canada\n403-544-4901\nRyan.Pfeifer@dcc-cdc.gc.ca\nWe are committed to providing you with the best service.
