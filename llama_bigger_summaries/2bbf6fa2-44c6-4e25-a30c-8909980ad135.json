Here are some things to consider:\n\n* They accidentally shared two identical attachments for the Sans Deutsch translation. In a real-world scenario, you would simply choose one of the identical files . Removing the extra should make it cleaner for our output. \n* For French readers, one description is simply an exact quote of the English. Another seems unhelpful and might be important to provide more information about the description of the CKFTA CFTA Agreements but is unclear what it should contain in the French translation.\n\nIn that case, we might keep one of those and remove unnecessary duplication. To avoid duplication and confusion, you should consider whether to keep one of the unnecessary materials or explain that you ignored it in your short summary. . Here's how you would explain that"
