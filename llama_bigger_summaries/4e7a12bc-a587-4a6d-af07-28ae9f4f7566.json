The instrument must separately determine elemental carbon (EC) and pyrolytic carbon (PC) during analysis of quartz filters to accurately separate the EC contained in the sample and the PC generated during the analysis. The analyzer must also estimate the amount of brown carbon (BrC) on the sample filters to address the constraining of the separation between OC and EC in samples loaded with biomass smoke, containing water-soluble and light absorbing organic compounds.\n\n### Trade Agreements\n\nThis solicitation is subject to the following trade agreements:\n\n*   World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO GPA)\n*   Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement\n*   Canada-UK Trade Continuity Agreement (Canada-UK TCA)\n*   Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)\n*   Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA)\n*   Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)\n*   Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n*   Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)\n*   Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)\n*   Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement\n*   Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)\n*   Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA)\n\n### Delivery Regions\n\nDelivery is required to the following regions:\n\n*   National Capital Region (NCR)\n\n### Contact Information\n\nIf you have questions or need further clarification on this solicitation, please contact Danielle Mignault (elle-la/she-her) at:\n\nDanielle Mignault (SPAC/PSPC)\ndanielle.mignault@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\n\n### Notice URL\n\nYou can access the full notice at:\n\nhttps"
