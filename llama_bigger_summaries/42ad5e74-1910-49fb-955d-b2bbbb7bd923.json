I have this JSON and I need to transform into a more readable structure, letting me access any field I need. Because legacy system are often poorly documented, the actual usage of the field will only become apparent after you have started creating a program that reads the field. The largest benefit i can imagine is to simplify the data structure. These types of structure are very tedious and equally time-consuming to work with due to(*) a shallow workflow, but are valuable hidden gems for any insights or dashboards that need to be created. Below are some conversion I have done: 1.Json formatted 2Converted into a specific data>: superiorly being programmatically accessible (read only fields are read only fields) Thanks for your assistance. The JSON I provided is in the format \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 If I convert the JSON to JSON format, the JSON structure would look roughly like this: Urlatted JSON FIELD-division-cptoms.Jsonformat json \u2212 table.Let me explain what I want in plaintext. The JSON object that I provided is a dense, human-unfriendly, and nearly unusable format. The goal is to convert this JSON object into a format that allows fast and efficient access to any field. For this, I would like to transform the JSON object into a more readable structure with parent-child functionality when used iteratively. I would also like to simplify the structure of the JSON object. Ultimately, my goal is to make it easier to extract the key information from the dense, human-unfriendly JSON object that I was provided. JSON can be thought of as a strict hierarchy of nested objects. With the goal of making the data accessible in a more human-friendly way, I would like to simplify the structure and make it programmatically accessible. I would like to separate the data into distinct sections and create more readable groupings, making it easier for humans to understand. Therefore, I would like the JSON object to be restructured in a way that is as flat as possible. Related fields should be grouped together. The JSON object I provided earlier is approximately 20,000 characters. I would like to reduce the size of the JSON object while preserving the essential information. Below are requirements that I hope you can fulfill, leaving the data structure similar in intent but with a flattened option where this is feasible \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 Similar to data transformation request consecutive to several paragraph on character I want to flatten the JSON doubles layer hierarchy with repetitive double asterisks (* th steps adorn, match *icone*, SC\u010dila Screth disabled mother objects.
