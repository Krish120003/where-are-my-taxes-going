The dates and contract details have been rephrased for clarity. The rewritten version meets the 400-word limit.\n\nIf you want to improve further, here are some suggestions:\n- You can add a brief introduction to provide context for the reader.\n- Consider adding a \"more information\" or \"links\" section to indicate where interested parties can find more details about the contract.\n- If the contract has associated files or documents that can be shared publicly, include a \"documents\" or \"attachments\" section.\n- Of course, if any fields in the original document are missing (e.g., regions of delivery, etc.), it's best to note them as such. \n- For the sake of this example, the name of the contact person has not been verified against other information sources (e.g., LinkedIn). While unlikely, please consider verifying names, especially if you are looking at potentially doing business with this entity.\n\nI will be happy to answer any additional questions you might have. Best regards, and have a great day!  \t\t\t  \n\n###Correspondance Connaytie\n\nWe have provided guidance on the rewriting and composition of the revised tender notice.
