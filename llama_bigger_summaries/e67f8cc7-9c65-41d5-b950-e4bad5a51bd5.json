The project involves the replacement of an existing climbable wind tower at Bonilla Island with a tilting-pole anemometer tower, which enables technicians to service the anemometer from ground level, reducing occupational safety concerns.\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\n* Geotechnical assessment\n* Detailed engineered foundation drawings specific to the site\n* Installation of the anemometer tower foundation and anchors\n\n### Project Background\n\nThe Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) operates a network of coastal weather stations, with anemometers measuring wind conditions 10 meters above the surface. Historically, anemometers were mounted on climbable towers, which raised safety concerns. In 1990, MSC introduced a program to replace climbable towers with tilting-pole towers. The project at Bonilla Island aims to replace the existing climbable tower with a tilting-pole tower by March 31, 2024.\n\n### Important Details\n\n* This is a two-phase selection process; the first phase will evaluate the qualifications of all bidders, and the second phase will invite qualified bidders to provide a financial bid.\n* A site visit is not part of this tender process.\n* The project is estimated to cost between $100,000.00 and $150,000.00 (taxes excluded).\n* The project documents can be submitted in either official language of Canada.\n\n### Contact Information\n\n* **Contact Name**: Shawn Davis\n* **Email**: [shawn.davis@ec.gc.ca](mailto:shawn.davis@ec.gc.ca)\n* **Phone**: (873) 500-0215\n* **Address**: 351, boulevard Saint-Joseph, Gatineau, QC K1A 0H3, Canada\n\nPlease visit the [Canadab"
