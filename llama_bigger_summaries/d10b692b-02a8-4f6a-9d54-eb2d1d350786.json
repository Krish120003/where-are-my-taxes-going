    "description": "The National Research Council (NRC) of Canada has a requirement for the supply of a megahertz femtosecond laser system and optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) for the Ultrafast Quantum Photonics facilities on Sussex. The laser system will expand our capabilities in the generation and manipulation of quantum states of light. The OPAs deliver high power, broad-bandwidth pulses of light that can be tuned across a wide spectral range in the visible to short-wave infrared regions, giving significant flexibility for research purposes.
