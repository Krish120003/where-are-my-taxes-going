    "full_summary": "### Tender Opportunity\n### Description \n\nThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) seeks to procure the services of professionals with expertise in data analysis, Tableau data visualization, and writing to support its Consumer, Research and Communications (CRC) Sector.\n\n#### About the Project\n\nThe CRC requires support in processing and validating financial and geospatial data, developing and designing Tableau dashboards, evaluating accessibility, analyzing, summarizing, and describing industry data for public and internal consumption.
