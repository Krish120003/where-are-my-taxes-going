ECD aims to develop a quantification framework to estimate the cost of producing hydrogen at the province level, considering regional and other relevant factors.\n\nCanada has chosen electrification as a major decarbonization strategy, aiming to transform its energy economy. To achieve this goal, Canada needs to increase electricity generation and supply capacity while ensuring its electricity generation fleet is emission-free. The Government of Canada is introducing the Clean Electricity Regulations (CER) to enable a net-zero electricity grid by 2035.\n\nThe focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power generation calls for the substitution of fossil fuel sources with non-emitting fuels/energy sources, including hydrogen. The Government of Canada is exploring the prospects of enhanced hydrogen production and future use for power production in Canadian provinces.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThe successful contractor will be required to develop a quantification framework that estimates the cost of producing hydrogen at the province level. The framework should consider regional and other relevant factors to ensure accurate cost estimates.\n\n## Unsolicited Requirements\n\nThe following Unsolicited Requirements are specified:\n\n* Project management\n* Economic or financial evaluation of projects\n* Electrical power transmission engineering\n* Financial assistance\n* Financial accounting service\n\n## Contact Information\n\n* **Name:** Carolyne Ch\u00e9nier\n* **Email:** carolyne.chenier@ec.gc.ca\n* **Phone:** (819) 307-1927\n\n## Attachment\n\nAttachments to this notice can be found at the following URLs:\n\nhttps://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/23460/en_rfp_5000075825_amendment-07.pdf\nhttps://"
