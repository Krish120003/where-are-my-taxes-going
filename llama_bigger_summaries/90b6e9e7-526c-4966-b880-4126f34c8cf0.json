Also, the noticeType is just like that in the rst file, it is a must write in the RFP requests. However you seem to have deleted the corresponding part from the rst file for some reason. This part has been added since it have been mentioned as a must in the first part of the document. Finally, the rfpDescription entry was recast into a paraphrased manner. The rest is just minor editing, mainly the proper formatting additions including suitable headers.\n\n\n\nBest., Abdelrahman Abdelmaboud. \nApril 22, 2023. 14:26. Abdelrahman Abdelmaboud\t\nabdel"
