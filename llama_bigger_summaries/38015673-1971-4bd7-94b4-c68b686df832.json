However, the output should be this concise JSON format since your request demands it. Notice how I made the column header titles in the most easier understandable form rather than touthing to its original column header format found on the Prompt. Seriously though with this data, it can be confusing.  Here it is formatted like how your requested in JSON format without making it interactive nor attempting any calculations but left as informative statements at most. { "
