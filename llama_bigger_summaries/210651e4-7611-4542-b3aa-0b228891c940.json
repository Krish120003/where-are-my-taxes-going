The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry stakeholders, obtain feedback on the Solid Waste Handling questions contained in Annex A, and to gain an understanding of available Solid Waste Handling systems.\n\n**Notice Details**\n\n* Publication Date: January 19, 2023\n* Closing Date: March 02, 2023 at 14:00:00\n* Opportunity Regions: National Capital Region, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia\n* Project Description: The DND is seeking to obtain information on Solid Waste Handling systems, including requirements, specifications, and industry feedback.\n\n**Notice URL** <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/01/18/0cff12a48e9a91b98568ea79d0723fad/ABES.PROD.PW_VCM.B004.F28924.EBSU000.PDF>\n\nThe following attachments can be downloaded from the above link:\n\n* The RFI document in English\n* The RFI document in French\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\n* Name: Lapointe\n* Email: kirby.dawson@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\n* Phone: (343) 552-1397\n* Address: Public Works and Government Services Canada, Louis St-Laurent Building (2), 2nd Floor - SC19, 455 De la Carri\u00e8re Blvd, Gatineau, Quebec K1A 0S5.\n\nNote:\n* Competitive Procurement Strategy: Not Applicable (Supplier sensitive information)\n* Documents may be submitted in one of the two official languages of Canada. I did some quite comprehensive rephrasing; you might consider asking me if you need any clarifications on certain points. The Canadian government is quite taken with these fancy acronyms; be sure to keep track of the RFI and other relevant documents!\nThis is the greatest problem; being reliant on others who may not have impeccable English language writing. \nReviewer: Line 3. The notice URL is broken. Before submitting the rewritten notice, I would like to see the revised format fixed.\n```md\n---\ntitle: RFI-VCM Solid Waste Handling"
