To achieve this objective, Shared Services Canada (SSC) has launched a social procurement initiative called ScaleUp, which seeks to increase the diversity of bidders on government contracts. This procurement is set aside for Canadian small businesses owned or led by underrepresented groups or Indigenous businesses.\n\n**Project Description:**\nSSC's Accessibility, Accommodation, and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) program provides individual support to employees with disabilities by offering assessments of their accommodation needs and access to an inventory of adaptive technology hardware and software. However, the program has identified a need for non-technical solutions to improve employees' work experiences. Occupational Therapists (OTs) can provide such solutions, adapting surroundings and tasks to meet client needs, supporting employees and managers with training and guidance for cognitive and learning disabilities.\n\n**Security Requirement:**\nA security requirement applies to this procurement. Refer to the Resulting Contract Annex, Security Requirement Checklist for further details.\n\n**Expected Contract Value:**\nThe total value of any resulting contracts will not exceed $238,000 (taxes included).\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nCanada lacks OTs who can provide ad-hoc, enterprise-wide holistic accommodation support for employees with disabilities and injuries. Refer to the ScaleUp Solicitation Statement of Challenge (SOC) for a detailed description.\n\n**Webinar:**\nA bilingual webinar will be held on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at 2:00 PM EST to provide clarity on Canada's requirement and to provide additional information about the procurement and bidding process. Register for the webinar by clicking on the following link: [insert link].\n\n**Invitation to Refine (ItR):**\nSSC will organize an ItR process after the webinar. Potential bidders can register by downloading the Invitation to Refine Rules of Engagement document and following the link: [insert link].\n\n**Solicitation Documentation:**\nThe solicitation package includes three separate documents: ScaleUp Supplemental Instructions, ScaleUp Solicitation and Bid Form, and Invitation to Refine Rules of Engagement.
