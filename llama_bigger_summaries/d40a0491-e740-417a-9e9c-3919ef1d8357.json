    "full_summary": "## Government Tender Announcement\n### Fabrication System for Atom-Scale Quantum Devices\n#### Reference Number: PW-23-01024934\n#### Solicitation Number: EN578-20ISC3\n\nThe Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) under the Innovative Solutions Canada (ISC) program, specifically Call for Proposals 003 (EN578-20ISC3).\n\n#### Tender Description\nThe ISC is seeking a fabrication system that enables the creation of atom-scale quantum devices. This system should be capable of accurately creating single atom quantum dots and spin centers on a silicon surface. The ISC is interested in a device that can operate at 4 K temperature, maintain a stable tunnel current of at least 1 pA, and achieve ultrahigh vacuum.\n\n#### Desired Outcomes\nThe proposed solution must meet the following essential criteria:\n\n1.  Demonstrate atom-resolution images of silicon (100) in both Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Qplus Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).\n2.  Provide a linear scanner operating in open loop.\n3.  Operate at 4 K temperature for sample and scanner.\n4.  Demonstrate a stable, measurable tunnel current at least as low as 1 pA.\n5.  Be prepared as an ultrahigh vacuum tool.\n6.  Have separate vacuum systems for atomic fabrication, silicon preparation, and tip fabrication.\n7.  Achieve ultrahigh vacuum ~ 1e-10 Torr for all vacuum systems.\n8.  Meet additional criteria, such as no measurable creep and hysteresis under normal scanning speeds and over the full range of motion.\n\n#### Tender Evaluation\nProposals will be evaluated based on their ability to meet the essential and additional criteria outlined above. The evaluation will be conducted in two phases:\n\n1.  Phase 1: Proposals will be evaluated on their ability to meet the essential criteria.\n2.  Phase 2: Short-listed proposals will be evaluated on their ability to meet the additional criteria.\n\n#### Tender Closing Date\nThe tender closing date is March 29, 2023, at 14:00 EDT.\n\n#### Contact Information\nFor any inquiries or clarification, please contact [TGSPC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca](mailto:TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca) no later than ten calendar days before the tender closing date."
