The work involves two phases, with the first phase focusing on recovering apatite from a 300 kg tailings sample. The recovered apatite will undergo hydrometallurgy to produce phosphoric acid and a high-purity REE carbonate. The high-purity REE carbonate will be used in downstream processing to produce individual REE separates.\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n\nTo be considered, interested suppliers must demonstrate the following:\n\n* Capability to accept a minimum 2-ton apatite-bearing carbonatite tailings sample\n* Ability to perform metallurgical tests at their usual place of business, including:\n\t+ Crushing and grinding of a 2-ton sample of apatite-bearing tailings\n\t+ Beneficiation of apatite-bearing carbonatite tailings using magnetic separation, heavy liquid separation, flotation, and chemical methods\n\t+ Recovery and extraction of REE to form REE carbonates\n* Experience performing the above tests on sample sizes of at least 2 tons within the past five years\n* A proposed resource with a university degree in a relevant field and a minimum of two years of experience providing scientific analysis of test results\n\n**Trade Agreements:**\n\nThis procurement is subject to the following trade agreements:\n\n* Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)\n* Revised World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP)\n* Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)\n* Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)\n* Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)\n* Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)\n* Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (Canada-UK TCA)\n* Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA)\n\n**Justification for Pre-identified Supplier:**\n\nSaskatchewan"
