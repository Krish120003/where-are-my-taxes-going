Understand the governing fundamentals of H2 metabolism in different reservoir types.\n2.  Investigate the presence of enzymes for potential H2 oxidation (hydrogenases) in oil reservoirs and salt caverns.\n3.  Determine the viability and potential activity of hydrogen-oxidizing populations in proposed H2 storage sites in Canada.\n\n**Scope of Work:**\n\n- Determine the current state of knowledge on H2 metabolism in oil reservoirs and salt caverns.\n- Identify the enzymes (hydrogenases) present in these formations that can oxidize H2.\n- Determine if hydrogen-oxidizing populations are viable and potentially active in proposed H2 storage sites in Canada.\n\n**Contract Details:**\n\n- **Contract Period:** The proposed period of contract is from the date of contract award to March 31, 2023, including three additional one-year option periods.\n-  The study will provide insights to policymakers and industry regarding the risks and requirements for safe H2 storage in Canada.\n- Furthermore, the findings will contribute to updating CSA Z341, the Canadian standard for hydrogen storage.\n\n**Pre-Qualification Criteria:** Suppliers must meet the pre-qualification criteria outlined in the solicitation document.\n\n**Notice Type:** Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN)\n\n**Procurement Method:** Competitive - Limited Tendering\n\n**Contracting Entity:** Natural Resources Canada\n\n**Point of Contact:** Nidhi Nigam, NRCan, (587) 337-3877, nidhi.nigam@NRCan-RNCan.gc.ca\n\n**Documentation:** The tender documentation, including the solicitation document, is available on the Canada's Buy and Sell website at <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2022/12/14/3a84081f42492690004b178cac17c011/acan_nrcan-_5000071266.pdf> (English) or <https://canadabuys"
