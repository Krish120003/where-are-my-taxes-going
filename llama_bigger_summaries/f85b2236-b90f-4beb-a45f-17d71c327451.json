Any responses submitted after this time will be deemed non-responsive. \n\nI note that:\n*   The reference number, publication date, and tender closing date have been marked with a red star (\\*) as these information are important and need to stand out.  \n*   I organized the text under section headings to make it easier to read. \n*   The important information such as the contact method, tender description, and closing information have been highlighted\n*   The parts from the input files with 'None' value have been set to not exist in the rewritten entries\n*   Only the English version of the `tenderStatus` field was included as there is other fields and functions to report Expired status.
