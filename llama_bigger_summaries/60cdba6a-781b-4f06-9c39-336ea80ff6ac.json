    "full_summary": "**Government Tender Announcement**\n====================================\n\n## Invitation to Tender: Air Health Trend Indicator\n\n### Description\nHealth Canada invites qualified contractors to submit a proposal to extend the current Air Health Trend Indicator (AHTI) in two areas: study areas (census divisions) and advanced model on trend detection.\n\n### Background\nThe AHTI provides information on the health risks associated with short-term exposures to air pollution, specifically ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The current AHTI reports have been posted on the Environment and Climate Change Canada website since 2011. However, there are three main concerns with the current AHTI:\n\n1.  It only represents urban cities and excludes rural areas.\n2.  It detects linear trends (or monotonic change) only, whereas a more advanced statistical model is required to detect non-linear trends.\n3.  It models a single pollutant, whereas simultaneous consideration of multiple pollutants is essential.\n\n### Objectives\n\nThe objectives of this project are to:\n\n1.  Include rural areas in addition to urban centers.\n2.  Detect non-linear trends using advanced statistical methods.\n3.  Consider multiple pollutants simultaneously in the trend detection model.\n\n### Deliverables and Requirements\n\nThe contractor is expected to:\n\n*   Develop and implement a new AHTI model that addresses the above concerns.\n*   Provide regular progress updates and final report with findings and recommendations.\n\n### Tender Details\n\n*   **Reference Number**: PW-22-01016016\n*   **Solicitation Number**: 1000246673\n*   **Publication Date**: December 5, 2022\n*   **Tender Closing Date**: January 9, 2023, 2:00 PM EST\n*   **Contracting Entity**: Health Canada\n\n### Submission Requirements\n\nProspective contractors must submit their proposal electronically to [Health Canada's e Tendering Portal](https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-surveillance), along with any supporting documentation. The proposal must include the following:\n\n*   A detailed description of the contractor's approach and methods\n*   A proposed timeline and milestones\n*   Relevant experience and qualifications\n*   A detailed budget and cost breakdown\n\nThe tender package, including the Request for Proposal (RFP) document and supporting materials, can be found on the [Health Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/).\n\n---\n\nPlease note that the rewritten entry is 394 words, and there is 6"
