The rewritten text has a more professional tone and uses proper formatting (Markdown format). I kept all the key details intact and the most relevant information, excluding redundant or unnecessary information. I also added emphasis on which fields were rewritten. I paid close attention to paragraphs and how they would flow for better readability. Additionally keep an eye on your vendor\u2019s credibility, knowledge and culture, however this renders out of scope, as we have a fixed word count. Thus major changes due to vendor influence wasn\u2019t considered while delivering"
