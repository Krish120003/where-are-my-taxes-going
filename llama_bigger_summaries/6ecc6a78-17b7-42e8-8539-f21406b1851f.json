The first sample aliquot is sent directly to the ICP-MS instrument for total elemental quantification, while the second is sent to a column for species separation, quantified by the ICP-MS.\\n\\nFor this reason one LC system comprised of two separate eluent streams combined with eluent redirection is required to meet future needs of these projects.\\n\\nIn all cases the LC system must be fully inert, meaning that it will not contribute metal to the sample and is made of materials that are resistant to liquids in the pH range of 0 to 14 and various types of organic eluents.\\n\\nThe LC must also be fully automated, programmable and controllable by a standalone computer.\\n\\nThe following requirements are the mandatory technical evaluation criteria which will be evaluated during the Bid Evaluation: CriteriaThe liquid chromatography system must be configured to provide two independent eluent flow paths, each with their unique pump, injection valve, column compartment and detector.\\nThe system can share one auto sampler provided it is combined with a diverter valve for each eluent flow path.\\n\\nMust be equipped with a chemically inert analytical isocratic pump combined with an eluent degassing module.\\n\\nMust be equipped with a chemically inert analytical gradient pump combined with an eluent degassing module, capable of mixing up to four mobile phases delivering linear, concave, and/or convex gradients in a precisely controlled proportions and flow rates.\\n\\nMust be equipped with two temperature controlled conductivity detectors for the quantifying anions in liquid samples.\\n\\nMust be equipped with a UV-Vis variable wavelength detector with 4 unique wavelength channels for the quantification of anions.\\n\\nMust be equipped with the capability of elem non ent suppression using a controllable and variable flow through , ion removing device.\\n\\nThe auto sampler must be capable of directing the liquid sample to either of the 6-port injection valves noted in item Mx.\\n\\nMust come with a hydroxide selective anion exchange analytical column and corresponding guard column for the separation of common inorganic anions.\\n\\nMust come with software to operate the ICS system and license to operate for up to three users.\\n\\nInstallation and training must be provided as part of the package.\\n\\nThe instrument must be CSA approved.\\n\\nFollowing technical evaluation, the selected supplier shall provide documentation, operation manuals, and support for the instruments.\\n\\nOfferors are required to provide certification and operation manuals\\n\\nBidder is responsible for delivery and installation of the instrument.\\n\\nBack up documentation for the bidder\\n\\nThe LCA requires incompatible offensive and invasive documentation aback of system home and Customers.\\n\\nSupplies should be delivered to 580 Booth St. Ottawa ON K1A 0E4 in a package specially designed to protect the instrument during transit.\\n\\nThe instrument must be CSA approved.\\n\\nOfferors may be requested to provide maintenance services and training to end-users after the instrument has been delivered.\\n\\nBidder\\",
