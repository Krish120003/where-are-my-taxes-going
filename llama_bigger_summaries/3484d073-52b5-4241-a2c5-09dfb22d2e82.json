The objective is to define the hazards associated with SE during transportation and handling of large, high-voltage lithium-ion ESS. The scope of the study includes identifying strategies and technologies for managing SE to reduce hazards and mitigate potential risks.\n\n### Study Objective\nThe primary objective of the study is to:\n\n1.  Define the hazards caused by SE during transportation of lithium-ion ESS, taking into account various factors such as ESS type, specification, mode of transportation, and state of the ESS.\n2.  Identify strategies and technologies for managing SE to reduce hazards and mitigate potential risks.\n\n### Key Considerations\nThis study will focus on large, high-voltage lithium-ion ESS, excluding batteries with capacities below 300Wh. The study will also explore relevant regulations, standards, and industry best practices currently in place.\n\n### Expected Outcomes\nThe successful proposer will provide a comprehensive report detailing the hazards associated with SE, and proposing strategies and technologies for managing SE to ensure safe transportation of lithium-ion ESS.\n\n### Eligibility and Requirements\nFor more information on eligibility and requirements, please refer to the attached documents.\n\n### Contact Information\nInterested parties may contact Natasha Blackstein at (343) 550-2321 or natasha.blackstein@tc.gc.ca.\n\n### Attachments\nThe following documents are attached and form part of this RFP:\n\n*   `Appendix B, TP929: Transportation Development Centre Publication Guidelines for Contractors \u2013 March 2005 Edition` <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/24406/appendix-b_tp929_transportation_devlopment_centre_publication_guidelines_for_contractors-_march_2005_edition.pdf>\n*   `RFPI FR T8080-230227 (French Language)` <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/24406/rfp_fr_t8080-230227_0.pdf>\n*  "
