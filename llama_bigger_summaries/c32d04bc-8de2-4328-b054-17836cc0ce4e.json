    "description": "Transport Canada seeks a consultant's opinion on the safety and feasability of their proposed combined aire flow system. This system will combine the air of various train cars to improve brake efficiency. However, this will also require a significant upgrade to the train's controls and systems. This contract is for a technical review and analysis of the designs and proposed implementation of the system. The consultant will review all relevant documentation, identify potential risks and safety concers, and review the testing and simulation data to determine if the proposed system meets the requiremements of safety and efficiency.",

Interested suppliers can submit a statement of capabilities to express interest in bidding.\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe technical review aims to assess the safety and performance of Canadian National Railway's (CN) proposed operating procedures for combined air flow, compliance with Railway Freight and Passenger Train Brake Inspection and Safety Rules, and the identification of potential operating conditions under which the proposed rule changes could lead to sub-optimal safety.\n\n**Tender Requirements**\n\nTo be considered, suppliers must demonstrate the following essential requirements:\n\n1.  **Technical Expertise**: A minimum of 10 years of experience in providing engineering consultations on railway matters to federal regulators, analyzing exemption/waiver documentation, simulating and analyzing train brake performance and train dynamics, and leading/developing at least 5 projects related to the simulation of train braking system performance.\n2.  **Project Management**: Possess a project team with advanced degrees in the field of engineering, particularly in Mechanical Engineering, and a professional engineering designation from a recognized engineers\u2019 association.\n3.  **Knowledge and Understanding**: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of rail operating environments, training simulation software, train brake modeling, and the North American rail network.\n\n**Services Required**\n\nThe selected supplier will need to conduct a technical review of CN's work, analyze background documentation, and provide a detailed project plan for conducting analytical simulation efforts. The supplier must also submit a final report outlining the methodology and findings of the analysis, as well as identify any outstanding issues or concerns that were not addressed in CN's testing and research.\n\n**Pre-Identified Supplier**\n\nSharma & Associates, Inc. (SA) has been pre-identified as the supplier due to their experience in providing technical services to federal regulators, simulating train braking system performance, and developing the Train"
