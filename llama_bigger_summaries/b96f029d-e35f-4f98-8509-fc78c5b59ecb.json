The contract will support the country's objectives in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement.\n\n### Scope of Work\n\nThe contractor must analyze and report ultra-trace results for fish tissue samples submitted by ECCC, as requested. The contract will cover analysis for one or more chemical classes, including Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), and Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD). Samples will be analyzed for lipid and moisture content.\n\n### Chemical Classes\n\n* PFAS: Analysis will include detection of ultra-trace levels of PFAS and their metabolites.\n* PBDE: Analysis will include detection of ultra-trace levels of PBDE and their metabolites.\n* HBCDD: Analysis will include detection of ultra-trace levels of HBCDD.\n\n### Contract Requirements\n\n* Payment will be based on the chemical class(es) requested and the number of samples submitted.\n* The contractor will be responsible for method blank and laboratory replicate analyses as part of their quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program.\n* ECCC reserves the right to award up to three separate contracts based on one contract per chemical class.\n\n### Contract Terms and Conditions\n\n* The contract duration is from June 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024.\n* ECCC has a funding level sufficient to support the contract commitments.\n\n### Contact Information\n\n* Heidi Noble\n* Heidi.Noble@ec.gc.ca\n* (289) 348-2015\n\n### Notice URL and Attachments\n\n* English: <https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/4805/solicitation-5000065856_en.pdf>\n* French: <https://canadabuys.canada"
