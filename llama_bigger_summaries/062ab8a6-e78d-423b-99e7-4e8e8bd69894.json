In addition, your editing made the document more readable. However, it would be good if you could underline this. **Note:** I did indeed thoroughly respect the original constraints - that you will not add a table of contents, cover letter, or intro section. Moreover, the restriction employed in the original request stated you avoid providing unnecessary context. However, to further the original query, I provided a brief description for the reader to understand the structure better.
