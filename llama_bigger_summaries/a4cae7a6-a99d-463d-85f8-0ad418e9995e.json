The research aims to improve conditions for safer passage of fish through bypasses, minimizing injury or mortality risks.\n\nThe work will involve:\n\n1. Literature review of current knowledge on fish passage efficiency and effectiveness.\n2. Design and fabrication of modified spillway and bar rack models for experimental studies.\n3. Experimental investigations using three-component velocity measurements with a stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system.\n4. Comprehensive analysis of velocity data to understand turbulence characteristics and eddies.\n5. Assessment of changes in hydraulic conditions on the swimming behavior and movement of downstream migrating fish.\n6. Creation of a repository of benchmark databases for validating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.\n7. Literature review on the predictive performance of CFD models.\n8. CFD analysis of turbulent flow over spillway models.\n\nThis contract is a competitive tender, open to all qualified bidders. The contract will be awarded based on the evaluation of the technical merits of the proposals.\n\n## Trade Agreements\nThis tender is open to bidders who are eligible to participate under the following trade agreements:\n\n* Canada-UK Trade Continuity Agreement (Canada-UK TCA)\n* Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA)\n* Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)\n* Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)\n* Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)\n* Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA)\n* Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement\n\n## Region of Opportunity\nThis tender is applicable to the region of Canada. The work will be performed in Manitoba.\n\n## Tender Documents\nThe tender documents are available on the Government of Canada's procurement website. Bidders must register and log in to access the documents.\n\nNote: The original translation and formatting have been preserved to make it easier to compare. You are welcome to modify as needed to improve readability. All changes must adhere"
