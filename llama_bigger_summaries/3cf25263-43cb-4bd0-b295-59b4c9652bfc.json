    "description": "AMENDMENT TO CLOSING TIME: Please disregard the Ariba Discovery posting response deadline closing time and Buyandsell posting closing time. You must submit your statement of capability by November 10th 2022 by 14:00 EST. An Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN) is a public notice indicating to the supplier community that a department or agency intends to award a contract for goods, services or construction to a pre-identified supplier, thereby allowing other suppliers to signal their interest in bidding, by submitting a statement of capabilities. If no supplier submits a statement of capabilities that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, on or before the closing date stated in the ACAN, the contracting officer may then proceed with the award to the pre-identified supplier. Environment Canada, National Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario, requires the supply and delivery of McLane Research Laboratories Inc. Remote Access Samplers. Any interested supplier must demonstrate by way of a statement of capabilities that its product meets the requirements. ",
