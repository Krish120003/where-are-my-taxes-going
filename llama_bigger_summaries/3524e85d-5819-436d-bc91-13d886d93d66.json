    "description": "<p>The National Research Council Canada (NRC) is in need of building condition assessments to evaluate the current condition of six of its real property assets.  <br>\"><br> The properties in need of assessment are: Buildings BOU-1, BOU-2, BOU-3, BOU-5, 75 boulevard de Mortagne, Boucherville, QC J4B 6Y4 ,\";\"; Buildings SAG-1, SAG-2, SAG-3, 501 boulevard de l'Universit&#x0020;est, Saguenay, QC G7H 8C3;<br>\"><br> These assessments are part of Real Property Planning and Management\u2019s (RPPM) on-going efforts to determine the most appropriate management strategy for the retention, maintenance and/or rehabilitation/renewal of the site, buildings and building elements in order to satisfy the Government of Canada\u2019s (GoC) current and future requirements as they relate to their Science Assets. <br>\"><br> Given the significant investment required to recapitalize these assets, the importance of a repeatable, rigorous, analysis of the inventory, including condition assessment, financial, utilization and adequacy, is critical to the ongoing life-cycle management of these assets. Building Condition Assessments provide foundational, detailed, technical information on which these analyses are based. <br>\"><br> The Building Condition Assessment process is used to assess the physical condition of real property assets. The intent is to generate building condition information that enables capital planning for rehabilitation, renovation and replacement based on objectively applied criteria of condition. <br>\"><br> For each building, the Building Condition Assessment must include the following information:  <br>\"><br> \u2022     General characteristics of a site, building and building elements  <br>\"><br> \u2022     History of additions, renovations or major system improvements  <br>\"><br> \u2022     Condition rating of building elements such as structure, building envelope, electrical, and mechanical systems  <br>\"><br> \u2022     Comments on maintenance requirements  <br>\"><br> \u2022     Comments on essential corrective/remedial requisites  <br>\"><br> \u2022     Information on the life-cycle capital cost of refurbishment or replacement of building elements  <br>\"><br> \u2022     Information on the current replacement value (CRV) or replacement cost new (RCN) of each building, including major group elements (ASTM Uniformat II Level 1), group elements (ASTM Uniformat II Level 2), individual elements (ASTM Uniformat II Level 3), and sub-elements (ASTM Uniformat II Level 4).    <br>\"><br> \u2022     Capital cost plans presented on a yearly basis for work over the next 25 year life-cycle of the buildings and elements  <br>\"><br> The concept of full life-cycle costing for a facility serves as the foundation for the development of a long-term capital plan. The 25-year capital plan should indicate the optimal timing/grouping of recommended \u2018events\u2019 into projects in order to minimize overall cost and building occupant disruption. <br>\"><br> Estimated quantity of commodity: 6 Buildings for assessment  <br>\"><br> Duration of contract: 2023-02-15 to 2023-06-30  <br>\"><br> Time frame of delivery: 2023-02-15 to 2023-06-30</p>",
