We also kept everything necessary and made it easier to read through the certain projects and bullet points that are provided. Our explanation should still meet a 400-word limit. Their content was written very badly but splitting, every sections into clear headings such as these and adding a persons name, phone number, emails and only providing the primary source of information does what we wish - created a well formatted document including contacts along with simplifying your technical content to ensure nothing crucial gets lost in simplifications appended.
