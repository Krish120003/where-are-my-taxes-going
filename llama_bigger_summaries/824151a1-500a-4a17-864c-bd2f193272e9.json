    "description": "1. What is an ACAN:  An ACAN is a public notice indicating to the supplier community that a department or agency intends to award a contract for goods, services or construction to a pre-identified supplier, thereby allowing other suppliers to signal their interest in bidding, by submitting a statement of capabilities. If no supplier submits a statement of capabilities that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, on or before the closing date stated for in the ACAN, the contracting officer may then proceed with the award of a contract.2.  In connection with budget 2020-2021 and 2022-2023, the IRCC Client Support Center (CSC)launched a modernization project requiring a change to its critical operational strategies inorder to respond to the significant increases in volumes; over 90% in 3 years all the whilemandated to increase its accessibility rate from 25% to 50%-60%. In 2021-2022, the need touse a process simulator to understand the risks and impacts of these changes downstreamwere identified. The historical increase in the volume of calls and emails generated during thepandemic, combined with the significant loss of capacity of the CSC, contributed to theurgency of needing access to simulation tools promptly. As the use of a simulator requiresaccess to a large volume of operational data, the CSC first leased the ARENA processsimulator licenses (via the company SimWell) for one year in order to complete a pilot whichaimed to confirm that the CSC had access to the data necessary to build models with such asimulator.3.
