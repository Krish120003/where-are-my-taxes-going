Since 2017, the government has implemented measures to reduce vessel traffic and protect the iconic species. However, knowledge gaps remain regarding the specific impacts on industry stakeholders.\n\nThe report will evaluate the economic costs of Transport Canada's vessel traffic management measures on the transit costs of the commercial vessel and fishing industries. The study will focus on the following:\n\n*   Identify the impact of Transport Canada's vessel traffic management measures on commercial and fishing vessel traffic in the Gulf of St. Lawrence between 2017 and 2022.\n*   Evaluate the economic impacts of the measures on commercial vessel industry costs.\n*   Evaluate the economic impacts of the measures on fishing industry costs.\n\nThe study's findings will provide insights to inform Transport Canada's future vessel traffic management decisions and the development of measures that balance protection goals with the needs of industry stakeholders.\n\n### Requirements and Instructions\n\n*   Refer to the attached PDF document for detailed information on the requirement and study parameters.\n*   Suppliers interested in bidding on this solicitation must submit a statement of capabilities by the tender closing date.\n*   The contracting officer may proceed with the award to the pre-identified supplier if no supplier submits a capable bid.\n\n### File Links\n\n*   [English ACAN Document](https://canadabuys.canada.ca/sites/default/files/webform/tender_notice/9031/en-acan---impacts-of-transport-canadas-north-atlantic-right-whales-%28narw-protection-measures.pdf)\n*   [French ACAN Document](https://canadabuys"
