Utilize an adaptive survey design to locate and delineate the spatial extent of the cod spawning area near Miscou Bank.\n2. Conduct trawling to collect biological samples and estimate the biomass of the cod spawning aggregations using target strength measurements.\n\n## Period of Contract\n\nThe period of the Contract is from Contract award through to March 31, 2024 inclusive.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nConsult the attached documents for complete tender details.\n\n### Attachments\n\nhttps://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/03/20/850fcf7912222484d588d82dd2058824/30004127_-_solicitation_addendum_2_-_addenda_-_bilingual.pdf\nhttps://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/02/28/313db9d78bbb014838e6ccbbf0ca9a69/30004127_-_rfp_cod_spawning_aggregations_and_trawls_en_final.pdf\nhttps://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2023/03/07/0ed11c2793777906fad65c6e46e585f0/30004127_-_addendum_1.pdf\n\n**Please note that this entry has been rewritten with key information, but does not include all information shared from the contractor. Some details were omitted for brevity and focus on inclusivity in both English and French languages.** [Note: I kept the original information about the objection and the request for proposals while removing all redundant content.] \nLet me know if there"
