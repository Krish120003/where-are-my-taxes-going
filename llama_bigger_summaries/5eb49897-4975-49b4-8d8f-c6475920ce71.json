    "full_summary": "### Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Sample Analyses\n\n#### Request for Proposal (RFP)\n\nThe government of Canada, through Environment Canada, is seeking a contractor to conduct analyses of samples collected as part of active Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) surveillance efforts.\n\n**Background**\nHPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is an emerging virus in Canada and North America, severely impacting migratory birds. The current outbreak has affected multiple species of migratory birds, leading to increased mortality rates. To better understand the risk of geographical spread, transmission, and persistence, predictive spatial modelling is essential.\n\n**Objective**\nThe contractor will conduct analysis of up to 29,100 samples for matrix PCR from wild birds collected as part of ongoing HPAI surveillance efforts over the next three years. The contractor will also analyze up to 5,400 non-negative matrix samples for H5 and H7 subtyping over the same period. The contractor will report all results back to Environment Canada and provide non-negative matrix PCR and H5/H7 samples results to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease.\n\n**Requirements**\nTo be eligible, the contractor must be a current Partner of the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network (CAHSN) and hold ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for PCR detection of Type A Influenza and avian H5 and H7 subtypes. The contractor must also maintain enhanced turnaround times during periods of increased sample submissions.\n\n**Key Details**\n\n*   Tender reference number: 5000068655R\n*   Solicitation number: 5000068655R\n*   Tender closing date: 2022-12-23 15:00:00 EST\n*   Attachments:  \n    *   https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2022/12/09/86b941e18b7b6cc0144fcb71ec355c28/5000068655r_rfp_eng.pdf\n    *   https://canadabuys.canada.ca/documents/pub/att/2022/12/09/684247a30da068b6558e1ab956f09223/5000068655r_rfp_fre.pdf\n*   Contact information:\n    *   Name: Davis, Shawn\n    *   Email: shawn.davis@ec.gc.ca\n    *   Phone: None\n    *   Fax"
