Data collection will be carried out using various techniques and equipment including drop camera video transects to provide data on presence, distribution, and abundance of benthic species and substrate types. There are also eDNA water sample collections using a rosette system. Passive multibeam data collection will also take place. Additionally, benthic grab and/or a box corer will be used to collect sediment samples.   There are other sampling methods that can be used based on the area being studied. ",
