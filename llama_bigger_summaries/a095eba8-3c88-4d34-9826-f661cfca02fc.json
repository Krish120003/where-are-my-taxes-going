    "full_summary": "# Design and Demonstration of Silicon Photomultiplier-Based Compton Gamma Imager\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a Request for a Statement of Capabilities (RSC) for the design and demonstration of a silicon photomultiplier-based Compton gamma imager.\n\n## Background\n\nNatural Resources Canada (NRCan) requires a mobile radiation survey instrument that can provide real-time data on radiation levels. The instrument must be compatible with existing equipment and have advanced features such as automatic detection of radioisotopes and automatic alarming.\n\n## Requirement\n\nThe required instrument must have the following characteristics:\n\n* Compton imaging and self-shielding modes\n* Easy-to-operate, reliable, one-button operation\n* Capable of an image precision of 2\u00ba within 10 s for a 1 mCi source of Cs-137 at 10 m\n* Software interface displaying radiation data in real-time, including energy spectra, waterfall display, and anomaly detection\n\n## Statement of Capabilities Requirements\n\nTo be considered for this RSC, suppliers must submit a statement of capabilities that demonstrates their ability to meet the requirements outlined above. Suppliers must have at least 10 years of experience in the design and manufacture of high-sensitivity mobile radiation survey instruments and provision of these instruments to federal, national, state, or provincial agencies responsible for nuclear emergency response.\n\n## Trade Agreements\n\nThis procurement is subject to the following trade agreement(s):\n\n* Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)\n* Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)\n* World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO GPA)\n* Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement\n* Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)\n* Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)\n* Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA)\n* Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)\n* Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe evaluation criteria for this RSC include:\n\n* Experience in design and manufacture of high-sensitivity mobile radiation survey instruments\n* Provision of instruments to federal, national, state, or provincial agencies\n* Compatibility with existing equipment\n* Advanced features such as automatic detection of radioisotopes and automatic alarming\n\n## Closing Date\n\nThe closing date for submitting a statement of capabilities is December 18, 2023. Only one supplier, Radiation Solutions Inc., is considered to meet the mandatory criteria. If no other supplier meets the requirements, the procurement will proceed with the pre-identified supplier.  \n\nNote: I"
