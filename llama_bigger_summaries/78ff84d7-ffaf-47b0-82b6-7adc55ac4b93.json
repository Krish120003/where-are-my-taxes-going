The objective of this project is to develop analytical tools, technical documentation, and communication materials to inform decision-makers.\n\nThe project will support the Canadian Northern Panel to develop new options for international harvest sharing agreements concerning Canadian-origin Skeena and Nass sockeye salmon harvested in commercial fisheries targeting pink salmon in southern Southeast Alaska.\n\n### Objectives\n\n- Develop analytical tools to explore fisheries benefits and conservation risks associated with different fishing patterns and harvest rules under various run size and productivity scenarios.\n- Implement revisions to an existing simulation model to accommodate alternative harvest management strategies.\n- Summarize simulation model outputs and communicate results to decision-makers.\n- Contribute to the development of a technical report describing the simulation model, including the updated harvest model and initial settings and parameters.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe contractor will:\n- Develop an updated harvest model to explore alternatives to the current provisions.\n- Perform analytical work, including R programming, required to adapt and run the updated model with scenarios selected by a working group.\n- Provide training on model operation to North Coast DFO staff.\n\n### Key Dates\n\n* Tender Closing Date: 2024-07-24 13:00:00\n* Expected Contract Start Date: 2024-08-01\n* Expected Contract End Date: 2024-03-31\n\n### Contact Information\n\nFor more information, please contact:\nJackie Longmire\nFisheries and Oceans Canada\n301 Bishop Dr, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada E3C 2M6\n Phone: (506) 452-3676\n Email: [jickie.longmire@dfo-mpo.gc.ca](mailto:jlongmire@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)\n\n---\n\n### Attachments\n\n* https://canadabuys.canada.ca"
