Expected contract end date: December 31, 2024.\n\nThe Government of Canada announces a tender request for the procurement of storage sheds to support the housing needs of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in the Northwest Territories. The tender is governed by the Request for Proposal (RFP) method, with a selection criterion of lowest price.\n\n**Background**\nUnder the Isolated Posts and Government Housing Directive (IPGHD), the RCMP's \"G Division\" provides housing to its members in the communities they serve. In partnership with the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, nine communities are set to receive newly built houses. However, due to the smaller size of these new houses compared to the original Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) housing, a need for additional storage space has been identified.\n\n**Objectives and Requirements**\nThe objectives of this tender are to procure high-quality storage sheds that meet the specific needs of the RCMP in the Northwest Territories. The storage sheds must be self-contained, independent units that provide additional space for storage. It is expected that the successful bidder will provide all necessary supporting documentation and bid submissions by the closing date.\n\n**Eligibility**\nThis tender is open to all eligible bidders who have the requisite qualifications and expertise to fulfill the requirements of this tender. Bidders must confirm their eligibility as per the Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA), Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA), Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).\n\n**Tender Process**\nTo participate in this tender, interested parties must register on Ariba Discovery (http://discovery.ariba.com/rfx/16768089?extsite=MTY3NjgwODlfQU4wMTQ4NDA1MDk5Mg=) and provide all required supporting documentation and bid submissions. Please note that bids submitted after the closing time of 1200 MDT will be considered non-responsive.\n\n**Delivery Locations**\n"
