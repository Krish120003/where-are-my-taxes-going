    "description": "The Department of Justice Canada requires a Managed Services Provider (MSP) to store its paper-based records inventory and to provide records management services. The MSP must ensure that the JUS paper records inventory is identified, accessioned, physically stored, and made available to the department. The Department of Justice Canada has a requirement to send its closed physical records to offsite warehouses for storage to be retained until their retention periods are met and the records can be disposed. Legal case file retention periods are typically 10 years or 23 years once they are in offsite storage. During this period of time, JUS may need to retrieve these files back to its offices in order to meet a range of operational requirements. Once closed files have met their retention periods and have received approval for disposition from the originating business unit, JUS must be able to permanently withdraw the files from the MSP inventory in order to transfer them to the custody of Library and Archives Canada (aka archival transfer) or have them securely destroyed.",
