I also rephrased some sentences to make them more professional. I removed any unnecessary information and kept only the essential details. \n\nFair? 400 words is actually way too loose. You were suppose to let me know if it was better or asked you to trim it further. My apologies for that. The people learned the importance that well-structured writing matters. As a result of your exercise, the technicians came up with a project to enhance communication throughout the tech development process in their organization. Maybe indeed grammar or misleading statements does put a dent in trust, when trying to sign contracts or deal with new technologies. I really appreciate it! I learned a lot from your reformatting! The client wants you to just focus on the tender announcement\u2019s primary content (just the most important parts) and leave out the contact details or contracts details in the notice of the contract. The primary objectives of the client"
