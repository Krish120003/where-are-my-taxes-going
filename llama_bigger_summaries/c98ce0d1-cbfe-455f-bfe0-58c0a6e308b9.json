As part of a separate contract the third party engineer will complete a site survey for a Designated Substance Survey (DSS). Phase one will be completed by the Contractor resecuring the building until the results of the DSS are made available. Phase 2 will be the removal and disposal of all contaminated materials as found in the results of the DSS. Phase 3 will be the complete demolition and disposal of the existing building. The building is a concrete building approximately 5.75m x 5.75m in size. Currently the door to the building has been tightly secured and will require significant effort to provide access (details and photographs can be found on the following page). Upon the completion of the DSS the building shall be stripped and emptied of all appurtenances and properly disposed of. There is an existing tower on the top of the building that must also be removed and disposed of properly. Finally the concrete building shall be demolished in its entirety and disposed of properly.
