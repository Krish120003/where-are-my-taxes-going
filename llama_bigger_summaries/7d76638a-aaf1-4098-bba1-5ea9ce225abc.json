    "description": "The Department of Justice Canada has the mandate to support the dual roles of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada. The Department supports the Minister of Justice in his responsibilities for 49 statutes and areas of federal law by ensuring a bilingual and bijural national legal framework. The Department also supports the Attorney General as the chief law officer of the Crown. The Department provides legal advice to the Government and federal government departments and agencies represent the Crown in civil litigation. The Human Resources and Information Services Branches maintain the departmental Human Resources Management System and peripheral Human Resources applications. Approximately 800 employees use these applications. Department of Justice Canada acquired Nakisa OrgManagement (Nakisa) as the Government of Canada standard system for organizational charting. This software system solution is able to define, present, navigate, and query information describing an organization's structure. The department has been using this software since 2008. It is no longer supported by the vendor and is no longer compatible with Treasury Board Standard hardware. This bid solicitation is being issued by SSC. The resulting contract will be used by SSC to provide shared services to the Department of Justice Canada. It is intended to result in the award of a contract for one initial year, plus three (3) one-year irrevocable options allowing Canada to extend the term of the contract. ",
