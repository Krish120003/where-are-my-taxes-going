    "description": "The NRC is developing optical techniques to perform molten material composition measurement. The NRC is looking for an induction melting furnace with controlled atmosphere to melt steel and hold the molten material for one hour or more while optical measurements are performed. The optical measurement of the melt is performed in two ways: 1) using a lance with flowing inert gas to clear the optical path and material, and 2) through a transparent optical window that gives line-of-sight access to the melt from the outside.",
