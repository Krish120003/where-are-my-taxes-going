The output format and requirements are specified, but the input data does not seem to match the expected format. The expected output is a JSON object with specific keys and values based on the input data.Instead, the input data appears to be a large JSON object with multiple key-value pairs and nested objects. There is a lot of repetitive information, including two sets of French labels and values, which are likely for a multilingual application. The main issues are that the expected output keys do not have matching values in the input data, and some values are empty or do not make sense in the context of the expected output.",
