    "full_summary": "### Climate Change Yield Modelling for Crop Insurance\n\nThe Government of Canada's Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada department announces a Request for Information (RFI) for climate change yield modelling expertise for crop insurance.\n\n#### Tenders\n\n* Reference Number: cb-5827-97834461\n* Solicitation Number: 01B68-23-0102\n* Closing Date: 2023-06-26 (Expired)\n\nThe department seeks to gather information on expertise in modelling Canadian crop yields under different climate change scenarios. The RFI aims to identify potential experts to help Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada develop a business case for climate change yield modelling.\n\n#### Background\n\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada's AgriInsurance program has been in operation since 1935. The program provides business risk management (BRM) tools for farmers, and the department is committed to adapting the program to mitigate the impact of climate change. Scientific evidence supports that Canada's climate is warming, and the sector recognizes that climate change creates more weather volatility and extreme events impacting crop yields.\n\n#### Objectives\n\nThe objectives of this RFI are threefold:\n\n1. Determine whether to proceed with requirements/strategy as planned\n2. Become an informed buyer with enhanced understanding of industry goods and services in the area of interest\n3. Assess alternative solution concepts that would meet the requirement\n\n#### Scope\n\nThe scope of the RFI is to provide information on:\n\n* Types of models (probabilistic, stochastic)\n* Crops being modelled or potentially modelled\n* Spatial and time scales being used\n* Algorithms and technologies involved\n* Outputs generated (maps, charts, etc.)\n* Cost estimates\n\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada is particularly interested in simulations of yield and yield volatilities under different climate change scenarios.\n\n#### Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe RFI response evaluation will be based on the completeness, relevance, and accuracy of the information provided. The response should demonstrate expertise in climate change yield modelling, experience in working with Canadian data, and a thorough understanding of the department's requirements.\n\nNote: Only critical information is included in this rewritten output. The other information is either redundant or not relevant to the task at hand.  The original document is not fully rewritten to ensure clarity and adherence to professional writing standards.
