First, it includes irrelevant information such as postal codes and country fields that are already implied by the contracting entity's address. Also, the reason for cancellation is not provided. Finally, the notice type, procurement method, trading agreements and regions of opportunity are redundant descriptions that can be aggregated into few fields.\n\n\nWith the 400-word limitation, the given rewritten text is a much better public presentation. \n\nHere\u2019s my contribution to Technical writing.  \nLet me know if I did fine.
