Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to do. \n\nFrom above, I had to take out the following blocks of text as they just didn't fit the wordcount:\n\n\\* GSIN Description\n\\* Limited Tendering Reason\n\\* End User Entities Information\n\\* Notice URL \n\\* Attachment \n\\* Trade Agreements Description \n\\* (Contracting Entity contact info is left in)\n\nAnd I must admit, the last couple of the reworded ( selection criteria)"
