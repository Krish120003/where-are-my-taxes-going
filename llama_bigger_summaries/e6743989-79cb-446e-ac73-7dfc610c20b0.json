    "description": "Parks Canada is currently developing a conservation and improvement project in the Grande-Grave sector of Forillon National Park. The project aims to carry out priority restorations and to safeguard and improve several buildings of the Grande-Grave Heritage Site, which includes four houses: Elias-Gavey, Daniel-Gavey, Joseph-Gavey and Charles-Philip-Bartlett. The project's ultimate goal is to develop authentic accommodation in these heritage homes. To carry out this project, Parks Canada needs a contractor to build access roads and parking lots for the four heritage houses being restored as tourist accommodations. There are currently no access roads leading to the houses. These new access roads will initially be used by the teams carrying out the project, and then by future visitors who rent the homes. Construction activities will generally include deforestation, excavation and earthworks (cut and fill), construction of access roads and revegetation (topsoil, seeding). The main features of the access roads are: gravel composition designed for passenger vehicles and maintenance vehicles (trucks); maximum total length of approx. 600 m; one-way traffic, roadway width around 4 m, with widening in some places; maximum slopes around 25%; separate access for the Elias-Gavey house and a shared main road for the other houses, with entrances to each house. The work will be carried out at Forillon National Park in Quebec. The exact site is the side hill of the Grande-Grave Heritage Site, accessible via the South Sector road, less than 5 km from the entrance station. This is a very busy area for visitors to the park, open from early June to mid-October. All work must be performed in accordance with applicable federal and provincial regulations for the agencies that have jurisdiction over the work. The work is subject to the National Parks Act and its regulations, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Canada Labour Code and Quebec's Act respecting occupational health and safety. The work covered by this contract includes, but is not limited to, supplying all materials, labor, tools and equipment for the complete construction of the access roads. Specifically, the project should include, but not be limited to, the following components: coordination of the work schedule according to site occupancy; supply and installation of all required environmental protection measures, including erosion and sediment control for this sloping site, to be maintained throughout the project and removed upon completion; provision and maintenance of traffic and signage management and control for the duration of the project; transport and disposal of surplus materials (excavation residues) outside the park; restoration of all impacted areas at the end of construction; restoration of all off-road areas affected by construction; keeping pavement inside the park clean and dust-free throughout the project. The contract has a low anonymity, that is, the contractors are invited to bid after they have been qualified.",
