Some key actions were:\n* Limiting the length of the output to 400 words, even if it meant removing some details shared by the contractor.\n* Reorganizing the data to put the most important information at the front, with any secondary data left to the end of the rewritten text.\n* Creating an attention-grabbing title an sub-titles, aligned with government documentation (acronyms like PWGSC instead of explaining it completely).\n* Created a four level list heading\n* Proper phraseology selection to make it clear.\n* Straightforward formatting -reading helpful.\n\nGuest considerations were made about all factors shared, knowing that client satisfaction and all.\n\nAn advice for contract developers unsure about submitting a tender bid is:\n* Give precise focus on phrases confused contract developers who still clarify any singular phrase context"
