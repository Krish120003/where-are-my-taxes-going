    "description": "See attached Request for Proposal (RFP).  ContractionIFNg\u00e0y IP MN JaJG CharlesPalloHighly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (HPAI) of the clade 2.3.4.4b is a newly emerging virus in Canada and North America that severely impacts migratory birds.  The contractor will conduct analysis of up to 29,100 samples for matrix PCR from wild birds collected as part of ongoing HPAI surveillance efforts by ECCC and partner organizations over the next three years, according to the sampling framework outlined in section 3.1.  The contractor will also conduct analysis of up to 5,400 non-negative matrix samples for H5 and H7 subtyping over the next three years, according to the sampling framework outlined in section 3.1.  Following analysis, the contractor will report all results back to ECCC (i.e. Technical Authority) and provide all non-negative matrix PCR and all H5/H7 samples results to National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) in Winnipeg.  The contractor must be a current Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network (CAHSN) partner as well as ISO/IEC 17025 accredited for PCR detection of Type A Influenza and avian H5 and H7 subtypes.  The contractor must have the ability to maintain enhanced turnaround times during periods of increased sample submissions, allowing ECCC to detect occurrence and spatial distribution of HPAI cases across Canada to inform policy decisions and partner organizations of the current status which is of high importance given the rapidly evolving situation of HPAI in North America.\", ",
