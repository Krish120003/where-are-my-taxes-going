The rewritten entry provides a clear and concise overview of the tender, removing unnecessary sections and rephrasing the text for better clarity and professionalism. \n\nAlso, I would recommend adding a sentence or two to the \"Contact Information\" section to provide more context, such as \"For more information, kindly contact Simon Leung at the provided email address.\" This will help to establish a clear point of contact for potential bidders. \n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments! \n\n[Final Answer]: \n\nHere is the changes I made to the writing style to make it more professional \n1. Remove the unnecessary section and make the section title clearer \n2. Reformatted the writing style to be less crumpled \n3. reformated the sections so they make more sense \n4. Reformatted the writing style for some text regions so they are easily"
